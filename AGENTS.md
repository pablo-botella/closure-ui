Seamless JS UI for application interfaces — a collection of vanilla Web
Components (no framework, no build step on the consumer side) for forms,
data grids, status bars, tabs, lightboxes and more.

Drop a single `<script>` tag and start using custom elements like
`<closure-data-grid>`, `<closure-form-row>` or `<closure-btn>` directly in
your HTML.

Everything is **opt-in**. The custom inputs are form-associated and submit
natively inside a plain `<form>`, and the display components (grids, tabs,
status bars, lightbox, clock…) need no extra wiring. The server-driven
"closure" workflow (`<target-closure>` / `<closure-template>`) and form
grouping are a **feature, not a requirement** — reach for them when you
want posting without a full reload, response directives or dirty-state
tracking. They shine with rich components like `<closure-data-grid>`
(dynamic fetch, row/footer action buttons, master-detail), but you can use
most of the library without ever touching them.

# Helpers

Functions shared by closure-ui components. Loaded first in `_source.list`
so they are available before any component that calls them.

## `applyWidthRange(el)`

Reads the `wr="min,max"` attribute on `el` and applies it as inline
`min-width` / `max-width`. Used by `<status-part>`, `<status-buttons>` and
`<status-kv>` to expose a uniform width-range hint without each component
duplicating the parser.

| `wr` value | Effect |
|---|---|
| absent / empty                  | nothing |
| `*,*` / `-,-` (natural)         | `flex: 0 0 auto` (use intrinsic size) |
| `100px,300px`                   | both `min-width` and `max-width` |
| `100px,*` or `100px,-`          | only `min-width` |
| `*,300px` or `-,300px`          | only `max-width` |

`*` and `-` are interchangeable as "unset / unbounded" sentinels.

## Shared design tokens

The theming premise is **CSS can be used, never needed**: every component
ships complete defaults and consumes these shared tokens with the *same*
canonical fallback everywhere, so with zero page CSS the library looks
homogeneous — and declaring the tokens once (on `:root`, a wrapper, or an
element) re-themes everything in one stroke. See `examples/theming.html`.

| Token | Canonical default | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `--primary`       | `#4f46e5`    | accent: primary buttons, focus rings, selection |
| `--primary-light` | `#e0e7ff`    | soft accent: focus glow, hover washes |
| `--border`        | `#e5e7eb`    | every border and separator |
| `--bg`            | `#f9fafb`    | chrome surfaces: headers, footers, nav panels |
| `--text`          | `#111827`    | primary text |
| `--text-muted`    | `#6b7280`    | secondary text, labels, icons at rest |
| `--red`           | `#dc2626`    | errors, destructive actions, required marks |
| `--green`         | `#16a34a`    | success, active/live indicators |
| `--warning`       | `#d97706`    | warnings |
| `--font`          | `sans-serif` | UI text |
| `--font-mono`     | `monospace`  | tabular/timestamp text |
| `--radius`        | `8px`        | corner rounding of container components |

On top of the shared tokens, each component exposes its own prefixed hooks
(`--dash-*`, `--dg-*`, `--tab-*`, `--form-btn-*`, `--cfr-*`, `--summary-*`,
`--ska-*`, `--fh-*`, `--btn-item-*`, `--lazy-iframe-*`) — documented in its
own *CSS Variables* table. Component hooks with a semantic twin default
**through** the shared token (e.g. `--dg-border` → `var(--border)`,
`--ska-warn-color` → `var(--red)`), so the global palette wins unless the
component hook is set explicitly.

## `closureFreeSubmit(el, url, defaultMethod, opts?)`

The one encapsulated hidden-form submit of the library: builds a hidden
form targeting `url`, fills its fields, submits it — a full navigation to
the response — and removes the form node so it can't orphan in `<body>`
on a download / new-tab action.

Callers: `<closure-btn free url>` (default **POST** — an action button),
`<closure-btn-item url>` (POST, payload via its parent-merging
`getBtnData()`), `<dash-nav-item free url>` (default **GET** —
navigation), `<session-keep-alive>` (logoff POST and server-instructed
redirects), `<closure-data-grid>` (query-definition navigation and row
`navigate` actions) and `<closure-lazy-iframe post>` (form submitted
**into** the named frame via `opts.target`).

Method resolution, in precedence order (attribute steps need `el`):

1. boolean quick attributes on `el`: `post`, then `get`
2. `method="get|post"` on `el`
3. the caller's `defaultMethod`

Fields, first match wins:

1. `opts.fields` — caller-computed payload, names used as-is
2. `el.getBtnData()` when present — the closure-btn contract, keeping
   the source's own payload semantics (e.g. parent-menu merge),
   `section_`-prefixed
3. `el`'s `data-*` attributes, `section_`-prefixed when `el` has `section`

Extras: `el` may be `null` (pure caller-driven submit);
`opts.target` sets `form.target` (e.g. `_blank`); a GET submit is native
— the fields **replace** any query already on `url` — unless `preserve`
(the `opts.preserve` flag or a `preserve` attribute on `el`, mirroring
captured GET forms) folds the url's existing query params in as leading
fields so they survive. A GET with **no fields at all** (and no
`opts.target`) skips the form entirely and navigates plainly — no bare
`?` is appended to the url.

---

# `<signal-event>`

Aseptic one-shot event dispatcher. Used to deliver named signals from a
streamed HTML response (or any other HTML payload) to JavaScript listeners
on the page. The element never renders (`display: none`); on connect it
reads its `name` and `data-*` attributes, dispatches a `CustomEvent` (on
`document` by default — or a named element via `target-id`), and removes
itself. With `delay` it acts as a declarative, DOM-bound **timer**: the
signal fires after the delay unless the node is removed first.

By default it is decoupled — no registry, dispatches on `document`, no
bubbling. Listeners subscribe with the standard DOM API:
`document.addEventListener(name, handler)`. `target-id` opts into a
specific element only when you need one.

## Attributes

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| `name="x"`  | event name passed to `CustomEvent` (required) |
| `bubbles`   | if present, the event bubbles (default: `false`) |
| `target-id="x"` | dispatch on the element with this id instead of `document` (resolved **when the event fires**; a missing id logs `console.warn` and skips dispatch). Pair with `bubbles` so it still reaches `document` |
| `delay="N"` | fire `N` ms after connect instead of immediately — a declarative timer. Removing the node (or replacing its container) before then cancels it |
| `no-cancel` | **special cases** — with `delay`, keep the timer running even if the node is removed (opts out of cancel-on-disconnect; the signal then fires from a detached node) |
| `data-*`    | every `data-*` becomes a key of `event.detail`, with the `data-` prefix stripped; the key keeps its original kebab-case |

## Example

```html
<signal-event name="need-fingerprint"
              data-token="abc123"
              data-employee-id="42"></signal-event>
```

```js
document.addEventListener('need-fingerprint', (e) => {
  const token      = e.detail['token'];
  const employeeId = e.detail['employee-id'];
  // …
});
```

Delayed, targeted signal — a self-contained, non-blocking timer node:

```html
<!-- 5s after this lands, poke #live-grid; the rest of the payload runs now -->
<signal-event name="auto-refresh" target-id="live-grid" delay="5000"></signal-event>
```

## Behaviour

> **Note:** the element fires once and removes itself. For a script to
> receive the event the matching `addEventListener` must already be
> registered when the signal fires — in a streamed response, place the
> subscribing `<script>` earlier in the document than the `<signal-event>`.

> **Note:** by default the event is dispatched on `document` — the emitter
> need not know who listens (the point of the pub/sub split), and a scoped
> listener filters inside its handler. For a **targeted** dispatch prefer
> the `ClosureResponse` directives `dispatch-event` / `trigger-click`;
> `target-id` here exists mainly for the `delay` case (a delayed, targeted
> signal those synchronous directives can't express) and for HTML inserted
> outside the `closure-response` flow.

> **Note — timer bound to the node.** `delay="N"` fires the signal `N` ms
> after connect. Its lifetime is the node's: remove the `<signal-event>`
> (or replace its container with another response) and the pending dispatch
> is **cancelled** — declarative cancellation. A `target-id` is resolved
> **when it fires** (after the delay), so the DOM is settled by then; a
> missing id logs `console.warn` and skips.
>
> For special cases where the signal must outlive its node, add
> `no-cancel`: the timer keeps running after removal and fires from a
> detached node (held in memory until it does). Use sparingly — it gives
> up the "remove the node to cancel" guarantee.
>
> ⚠️ A delayed signal is **lost if the page navigates** (a `redirect` /
> full reload clears the timer). Use `delay` only for in-page signals; for
> something that must survive navigation, schedule it server-side.

# `<btn-grid>`

Shadow-DOM grid layout for action buttons.

Slots its children into a CSS grid with a configurable column count.
Provides default visual variables (`--form-btn-*`) consumed by `<closure-btn>`.

Use it to lay out a set of action buttons in an even, responsive grid with
consistent sizing and spacing — typically the button row of a form or dialog. It
is purely a **layout shell**: it slots whatever children you give it and supplies
the shared `--form-btn-*` tokens, but it does not create, enable/disable or
decide which buttons appear — that is the parent's job. (For a cluster *inside* a
`<closure-status-bar>`, use `<status-buttons>` instead.)

## Attributes

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| `cols="N"` | number of grid columns (default `3`; non-integers fall back to `3`, values `< 1` clamp to `1`) |
| `no-icon`  | hide icons inside slotted buttons and switch to compact text-only sizing (sets `--form-btn-icon-display: none`, `--form-btn-min-height: 0`, `--form-btn-padding: 14px 16px`) |



## Children

Any block-level button-like elements. Typically `<closure-btn>` instances.

## Example

```html
<btn-grid cols="2">
  <closure-btn ct-role="save">Save</closure-btn>
  <closure-btn ct-role="cancel">Cancel</closure-btn>
</btn-grid>
```

## CSS Variables

`<btn-grid>` declares defaults for these variables that slotted
`<closure-btn>` children consume. Override on the host (or any
ancestor) to customise the appearance:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--form-btn-padding`      | `28px 16px`                    | button inner padding |
| `--form-btn-font-size`    | `15px`                         | button label size |
| `--form-btn-bg`           | `#ffffff`                      | background colour |
| `--form-btn-color`        | `#111827`                      | text colour |
| `--form-btn-radius`       | `10px`                         | border radius |
| `--form-btn-shadow`       | `0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.10)`   | resting shadow |
| `--form-btn-shadow-hover` | `0 4px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.16)`  | hover shadow |
| `--form-btn-min-height`   | `110px`                        | minimum height |

Override example:

```css
btn-grid {
  --form-btn-bg: #4f46e5;
  --form-btn-color: #fff;
  --form-btn-radius: 4px;
}
```

> **Note:** the `--form-btn-*` variables are only consumed by slotted
> `<closure-btn>` children. Plain `<button>` or other block-level elements
> are laid out by the grid but won't pick up the visual defaults — style
> them yourself.

> **Note:** `gap` (14px) and the top/bottom margins are not exposed as
> CSS variables. To change them, override directly on the host:
> ```css
> btn-grid { gap: 20px; margin-bottom: 24px; }
> ```

# `<clock-display>`

Live wall-clock element synced to the server's configured timezone.

On connect, issues `GET /api/time?ts=<unix>` and uses the response to
compute a clock offset (factoring in the round-trip latency). After that
the time ticks every second from the local clock plus that offset.
Falls back to the local clock if the sync request fails or the global
`window.closure_clock_skip_sync_time` is truthy.

The displayed time uses the **server's** timezone, not the browser's.

## Attributes

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| `small`  | compact layout (smaller font, no margin) |
| `nodate` | hide the date row |
| `notime` | hide the time row |
| `dot`    | replace the "Server Time" label with a tiny `●` indicator; combined with `small`, renders time + dot inline |
| `no-local` | don't show the local clock while syncing — hold the `--:-- --` placeholder (size preserved) until the server time arrives, then start ticking. Avoids the brief local-then-server "jump" |

## Format

- Time: 12-hour `HH:MM AM/PM`.
- Date: en-US long form, e.g. `Monday, January 02 2026`.

## Example

```html
<!-- Hero clock -->
<clock-display></clock-display>

<!-- Compact header indicator -->
<clock-display small dot notime></clock-display>
```

## CSS Variables

Consumed (with fallbacks):

| Variable | Default |
|---|---|
| `--font-mono`  | `monospace` |
| `--text`       | `#111827`   |
| `--text-muted` | `#6b7280`   |
| `--green`      | `#16a34a`   |

## Behaviour

> **Note:** the clock-server sync runs once per element instance (on
> connect). To force a resync, remove and re-insert the element. There is
> no public re-sync method.

> **Note:** set `window.closure_clock_skip_sync_time = 1` early (before the
> element connects) to disable the network call entirely — useful in
> mockups and in tests where `/api/time` is not served.

> **Note:** with `no-local`, the first render is **deferred** until the
> sync resolves. If the sync **fails**, `_syncTime` still resolves (falling
> back to the local clock), so the clock starts then — `no-local` only
> suppresses the transient local-time flash on a successful sync, it does
> not leave a permanently dead clock. With `closure_clock_skip_sync_time` it
> starts immediately (there is no round-trip to wait for).

> **Note:** font sizes also break responsively at viewport widths of
> 768px (36px) and 500px (28px) via `@media` rules.

# `<credential-pwd>`

Masked password input with paste-friendly behaviour. Wraps a hidden
`<input type="password">` so the value participates in form submission,
while showing bullet glyphs (`●`) to the user. Designed to defeat
stored-credential autofill on shared admin screens.

It is meant to be a drop-in, **more secure `<input type="password">`**: it
works inside a plain native `<form>` — submission, validation and Enter all
behave as they would for a native password field, **with no dependency on
the closure system**. The closure-specific hooks (`enter-btn-id`) are
optional extras for dialogs, not requirements.

## Attributes

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| `name="x"` | form-field name (mirrored on the inner `<input>`) |
| `required` | mirrors HTML `required` validation |
| `readonly` | disables interaction (`tabIndex=-1`, `pointer-events: none`) |
| `has-value` | preload bullet placeholder (an existing password is on file) |
| `clear-behavior="edit\|focus"` | when a `has-value` field wipes its placeholder — `edit` (soft, **default**) on the first keystroke / paste; `focus` (aggressive) the moment it gains focus |
| `enter-btn-id="x"` | element activated by Enter (e.g. a `<closure-btn>` outside the form, as in dialogs) |

## Properties

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
| `.value` (get/set) | plaintext value |
| `.pasted` (bool)   | `true` if the current value came from a paste |

## Events

The native `invalid` event is intercepted: instead of letting the browser
show its tooltip, the host gets the `.field-invalid` class so callers
can style it.

## Example

```html
<form>
  <credential-pwd name="password" required></credential-pwd>
  <credential-pwd name="new_password" has-value></credential-pwd>
  <button type="submit">Save</button>
</form>
```

## CSS Variables

Consumed (with fallbacks):

| Variable | Default |
|---|---|
| `--border`        | `#e5e7eb` |
| `--font`          | `sans-serif` |
| `--text`          | `#111827` |
| `--primary`       | `#4f46e5` |
| `--primary-light` | `#e0e7ff` |
| `--red`           | `#dc2626` |

## Behaviour

> **Note:** a `has-value` instance shows a bullet placeholder for the
> existing (server-held) password; it never holds the plaintext, so the
> user always types the **whole** new password to change it. *When* the
> placeholder is wiped depends on `clear-behavior`:
> - **`edit` (default, soft):** the placeholder survives focus / tabbing and
>   is wiped on the **first keystroke or paste** — accidental focus never
>   blanks it.
> - **`focus` (aggressive):** the placeholder is wiped the moment the field
>   gains focus — for shared-screen admin panels where a stale value must
>   not linger.

> **Note:** on paste, the whole pasted string replaces the value and
> `pasted=true` is exposed. **Backspace then clears the entire pasted
> value** (no character-by-character editing). Type-after-paste also wipes
> the pasted content.

> **Note:** Enter mirrors a native `<input type="password">`. Priority:
> the `enter-btn-id` target if set (for dialogs / `<closure-btn>`s that sit
> outside the form — it clicks the element, routing a `<closure-btn>`
> through its `ct-role`); else the form's **implicit submission** — it
> clicks the default submit button (`[type="submit"]` or a typeless
> `<button>`) if present, else submits the form directly; else, with no
> enclosing form, it advances focus.
>
> A `<closure-btn>` action button (an `<a>`, not a `type=submit`) is **not**
> auto-discovered as the default — point `enter-btn-id` at it. Keeping the
> component free of closure-specific button discovery is intentional: it
> stays a drop-in native password field.

# `<data-map>`

Declarative value-to-attributes lookup table. Renders nothing
(`display: none`) — it's a markup-only store consumed by other
components (typically `<closure-row-viewer>` and `<closure-data-grid>`)
to translate raw row values into icon / label / colour or any other
attribute set.

## Children

A list of `<map-item>` elements. See `<map-item>` for the per-row
attributes.

## Methods

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `resolve(value)` | returns the attribute set of the first `<map-item value="…">` whose `value` equals the stringified argument; otherwise the row marked `default`; otherwise `null` |

The returned object excludes the `value` and `default` meta-attributes
— only domain attributes (`label`, `icon`, `color`, …) are present.

## Example

```html
<data-map id="status-styles">
  <map-item value="ok"   label="OK"     icon="✓" color="green"></map-item>
  <map-item value="warn" label="Warn"   icon="!" color="amber"></map-item>
  <map-item default      label="Other"  icon="?" color="gray"></map-item>
</data-map>

<script>
  const styles = document.getElementById('status-styles').resolve('warn');
  // → { label: 'Warn', icon: '!', color: 'amber' }
</script>
```

## Behaviour

> **Note:** comparisons are **string-based**. Numbers are coerced via
> `String(value)`, so `resolve(0)` matches `<map-item value="0">` but
> not `<map-item value="false">`.

> **Note:** consumers that pass values through `<data-map>` typically
> read both the result object and a `map-show="icon|label"` attribute
> on themselves to choose which fields to render — see
> `<closure-row-viewer>`.

---

# `<map-item>`

Single row of a `<data-map>` lookup. Renders nothing
(`display: none`); the element is a pure attribute carrier — every
attribute except the meta ones (`value`, `default`) is exposed as a
field of the resolved object.

## Attributes

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| `value="x"`     | the lookup key (compared via `String(arg)`) |
| `default`       | catch-all row used when no `value` matches |
| any other       | becomes a field of the resolved object (e.g. `label`, `icon`, `color`) |

## Example

```html
<data-map>
  <map-item value="ok"   label="OK"   icon="✓" color="green"></map-item>
  <map-item value="ko"   label="KO"   icon="✗" color="red"></map-item>
  <map-item default       label="—"    icon="?" color="gray"></map-item>
</data-map>
```

## Behaviour

> **Note:** an item with `default` and no `value` acts as the
> fallback. If you also set a `value` on the default row, it can match
> by both — usually you don't want that, so leave `value` off.

---

# `ClosureResponse` (global object)

Processes server-response HTML for closure directives. Not a custom
element — it's a singleton object exposed on `window` and called by
`<closure-template>` when its `<template-response parse="closure-response">`
child is present.

The processor parses the response HTML looking for a top-level
`<closure-response>`. If none is found it returns `null` and the caller
uses the HTML verbatim. Otherwise it executes each declarative directive
inside (`<response-item>`) in order, optionally distributing content to
named sections.

## Public API

| Method | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `process(html, closure)` | main entry — see `<closure-template>` |

Returns:
- `null` — no `<closure-response>` in `html`; caller renders `html` itself
- `{ handled: true }` — sections mode, response was fully placed
- `{ handled: false, html: "…" }` — non-sections, caller may insert `html`

## Markup the processor recognises

```html
<closure-response [sections]>
  <response-item type="…" target-id="…" key="…" value="…" …></response-item>
  …
  <closure-response-section target-id="…" [raw]>
    <!-- HTML to render into target; may contain nested closure-response -->
  </closure-response-section>
  …
  <!-- Tags whose name was registered with closure.subscribeTag(...)
       are forwarded to the corresponding subscriber instead of being
       interpreted as response-items. -->
</closure-response>
```

Attributes on `<closure-response>`:

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| `sections` | enable `<closure-response-section>` placement mode |
| `raw`      | skip parsing entirely; emit inner HTML verbatim |

Attributes on `<closure-response-section>`:

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| `target-id="x"`            | `getElementById` destination |
| `target-selector="css"`    | `querySelector` destination |
| `target-selector-all="css"`| `querySelectorAll` destinations |
| `raw`                      | write content verbatim, skip nested parsing |

## Where the response content lands

Directives always run first. *Content* placement then depends on the `sections`
attribute of `<closure-response>`:

| You want… | Markup |
|---|---|
| Replace the current `<target-closure>`'s content | `<closure-response>` **without** `sections` — the leftover HTML becomes its `innerHTML` |
| Run only directives / leave the container untouched | `<closure-response sections>` (even with zero sections) |
| Distribute content to specific elements | `<closure-response sections>` + one `<closure-response-section>` per destination, **each carrying its own** `target-id` / `target-selector` / `target-selector-all` |
| (button flow) land in a named element | `<template-response-ok target>` / `response-target-id` on the `<closure-template>` |

The `sections` attribute is the switch. **With it, the loose leftover content is
disconnected**: `process()` returns `{ handled: true }`, the caller leaves the
`<target-closure>` alone, and each `<closure-response-section>` places its body
at its own target(s). **Without it**, the leftover HTML is written into the
`<target-closure>`'s own `innerHTML`.

> ⚠️ A `<closure-response>` **without** `sections` that carries only directives
> (no leftover content) leaves an empty body — so the container's `innerHTML`
> becomes `""` and the current container is **wiped**. Add `sections` whenever a
> response should run directives without replacing anything.

## `<response-item>` types

### Target resolution

Every `<response-item>` (and every `<closure-response-section>`) picks the
element(s) it acts on with up to three attributes. They are **additive, not
mutually exclusive** — when more than one is present the matches are
**concatenated in this fixed order**, with **no de-duplication** (an element
matched twice is acted on twice):

| Attribute | Resolver | Matches |
|---|---|---|
| `target-id="x"`             | `document.getElementById`   | the one element with that id |
| `target-selector="css"`     | `document.querySelector`    | the **first** element matching the selector |
| `target-selector-all="css"` | `document.querySelectorAll` | **every** element matching the selector |

Resolution always runs against the **whole document**, not scoped to the
response fragment. Edge behaviour:

- **No target, or no match** → the item resolves to an empty list and becomes a
  **silent no-op** (`add-class` on nothing does nothing). Items that don't use
  targets at all — navigation, storage, `delay` — still run regardless.
- **Invalid selector** (malformed CSS from the server) → caught, logged with
  `console.warn`, and skipped, so one bad selector can't abort the rest of the
  queue.
- `focus` acts on the **first** resolved target only; the DOM / class / style /
  content items act on **all** resolved targets.

### DOM
`hide`, `show` (`display="…"`), `clear-content`, `remove`,
`add-class`, `remove-class`, `toggle-class` (uses `key`),
`set-style` (uses `key` / `value`), `set-text`, `set-html`, `set-value`,
`set-attribute` (`key` / `value`), `remove-attribute` (`key`).

`set-value` sets `.checked` on checkbox / radio targets (truthy values are
`"1"`, `"true"` or `"on"`) and `.value` on every other element.

### Navigation
`redirect` (`url`), `refresh`, `push-state` / `replace-state`
(`url`, `state`), `go-back`, `open-url` (`url`, `target`).

`redirect`, `refresh` and `auto-redirect` accept an optional
`target="_parent|_top"` to navigate the parent or top frame instead of the
current one (escape an iframe); omit it to stay in this window.

**The recommended — and effectively the only reliable — cross-frame use is
`refresh target="_parent"` against a same-origin return page.** The canonical
case is a payment-gateway iframe: the gateway redirects to *your* (same-origin)
return page inside the iframe, which fires `refresh target="_parent"` so the
host reloads and the server re-evaluates the transaction. Let the server decide
what happens next.

> ⚠️ **Cross-frame `redirect` / `auto-redirect` (`target="_parent|_top"`) is a
> discouraged practice.** It is kept for the rare same-origin (or
> user-activated) case, but should be avoided in general. Although the
> cross-origin Location policy *does* permit writing `location.href`, navigating
> a cross-origin parent/top frame is **additionally** gated by the browser's
> frame-navigation rules — it generally requires a real **user activation** — so
> a server-driven cross-origin redirect is frequently blocked in practice
> (anti-tabnabbing) and **fails silently**. Prefer `refresh target="_parent"`.
>
> Related gotchas: `refresh` itself calls `reload()`, which is **same-origin
> only** and throws `SecurityError` on a cross-origin parent; and
> `document.domain` is **not** a workaround for the subdomain case — modern
> browsers have disabled it.

`open-url` opens with `noopener,noreferrer` so the new tab can't reach back via
`window.opener`.

### Lightbox
`close-lightbox` (closes nearest `[open]` lightbox or the targeted one),
`open-lightbox` (calls `.open()` on each target).

### Storage
`set-local-storage` / `set-session-storage` (`key`, `value`),
`remove-local-storage` / `remove-session-storage`
(by `key`, `pattern="ab*c"` glob, or `regex`),
`clear-local-storage` / `clear-session-storage`,
`set-cookie` (`key`, `value`, `path`, `max-age`, `secure`, `same-site`),
`remove-cookie` (`key` or `pattern` glob, optional `path`).

### Events
`dispatch-event` (`event="name"`, all `data-*` go to `detail`),
`trigger-click`.

### Forms
`reset-form`, `submit-form`, `focus` (focuses first target).

### Timing
`delay` (`ms="N"` — pauses the queue for N milliseconds),
`auto-redirect` (`url`, `ms`).

### Closure
`clean-dirty` (`templates="*"` or `"a,b"`),
`mark-dirty`,
`execute-template` (`closure-template`, `ct-role`).

## Behaviour

> **Security — trusted HTML only.** `set-html`, `set-text`'s sibling
> content actions and `<closure-response-section>` render server-provided
> markup **as HTML via `innerHTML`** (this is the point of the engine, like
> `htmx`). Treat every response body as **trusted**: it is the server's job
> to escape any user-derived data before sending it. Never route
> third-party / user-controlled HTML through `ClosureResponse` unescaped —
> use `set-text` (which uses `textContent`) for untrusted strings.

> **Note:** the queue executes synchronously **except** for `type="delay"`,
> which yields via `setTimeout` and resumes the rest of the queue in the
> callback. Subsequent items therefore run after the delay.
>
> When it resumes, the queue is **dropped if the owning closure was detached
> during the pause** (e.g. its container was replaced by a newer response), so a
> delayed item can't inject stale content into a torn-down context. Caveats: a
> dialog that is merely *hidden* (not removed from the DOM) stays connected, so
> its queue still resumes; and a full-page `redirect` clears the pending timer
> on unload regardless. Use `delay` for in-page sequencing, not as a guarantee
> that the tail runs.

> **Note — global navigation timers.** Unlike `type="delay"` (which aborts if
> its container was detached, to avoid injecting HTML into a dead node),
> `type="auto-redirect"` is an **absolute, unstoppable deadline** by design: it
> delegates to a `setTimeout` that is **not** bound to the closure's lifecycle.
> If the server schedules a redirect in 5 s (e.g. after showing a success
> modal), the browser **will** navigate when the timer expires, even if the user
> closes the modal first. This is intended, not an orphaned timer. The
> navigation acts on the resolved navigation window (`window` by default, or the
> `target="_parent|_top"` frame) — independent of local DOM state, so the
> server's directive to leave the current context is final. (A full-page reload
> still clears it on unload, as with any timer.)

> **Note:** elements whose tag is **not** `<response-item>` are forwarded
> to handlers registered with `closure.subscribeTag(tagName, obj)`. This
> is how `<closure-lightbox>` claims the `<lightbox-response-item>` tag
> without `ClosureResponse` knowing about it.

> **Note:** `<closure-response-section raw>` skips the recursive parse —
> useful when a section legitimately contains literal `<closure-response>`
> text (e.g. documentation pages).

# `<target-closure>`

Independent container for one logical workflow: a body of forms and
buttons, plus the `<closure-template>` declarations that describe how
each button posts and what to do with the response. Closures may be
nested — each is independent, and forms inside a child closure belong
to the child, not the parent.

A closure also tracks **dirty state** per template (so observed UI like
"unsaved changes" badges or beforeunload prompts can react), exposes a
**tag subscription** API for plugins like `<closure-lightbox>`, and can
optionally **capture** form submits / anchor clicks happening inside
its tree.

> **Optional by design — a feature, not a requirement.** The whole
> closure / template / form-grouping layer is opt-in. The custom inputs
> (`credential-pwd`, `closure-checkbox-tree`, `closure-checkbox-group`,
> `fingerprint-hands`) are form-associated and submit **natively** inside
> a plain `<form>`, and every display component (grids, tabs, status bars,
> lightbox, clock…) works with no closure at all. Reach for
> `<target-closure>` only when you want the server-driven workflow:
> posting without a full reload, response directives, dirty-state
> tracking, or combining several forms. Form grouping in particular is
> opt-in — the default is `group-behavior="none"`, and a plain `<form>`
> with no `closure` attribute always submits natively, untouched.

## Attributes

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| `name="x"`                       | identity for `<form closure="name">` association from outside |
| `group-behavior="x"`             | how forms are gathered for submission — `none` (default), `combine-sections`, `combine-children` |
| `capture-inner-content="x"`      | which inner submits/clicks the closure intercepts — `none` (default), `targeted`, `forms`, `anchors`, `all` |

### `group-behavior` values

| Value | Effect |
|---|---|
| `none`              | each form is submitted on its own |
| `combine-sections`  | gather forms by section, **skip nested closures** |
| `combine-children`  | gather every form in the subtree, **including nested closures** |

### `capture-inner-content` values

| Value | Effect |
|---|---|
| `none`     | no capture (forms / anchors behave natively) |
| `targeted` | only forms/anchors with a `response-lightbox` attribute |
| `forms`    | every `<form>` submit inside |
| `anchors`  | every `<a>` click inside |
| `all`      | forms + anchors |

> **Note:** captured form submits are sent URL-encoded (not
> `multipart/form-data`), so **binary file uploads are not transported**.
> An `<input type="file">` is serialized like any other field, so the
> server receives the literal string `"[object File]"` as its value (a
> reliable "no real file" sentinel), never the contents. Use a plain
> native `<form enctype="multipart/form-data">` (no `closure` attribute,
> capture off) for file uploads.

### Form association

| Markup | Belongs to |
|---|---|
| `<form closure>`              | the nearest enclosing closure |
| `<form closure="name">`       | the closure with that `name` (anywhere in the doc) |
| `<form>` (no `closure` attr)  | nothing — submits natively |

### Observable dirty-state attributes

Place on **any** descendant of a closure:

| Attribute | Effect |
|---|---|
| `dirty-show="show"` | visible when the closure is dirty, hidden when clean |
| `dirty-show="hide"` | hidden when dirty, visible when clean |
| `dirty-template="name"` | scope the watch to one template (default: any) |

## Public methods

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `subscribeTag(tagName, obj)` | route every `<tagName>` element in a server response to `obj.onClosureTag(tagName, el)` |
| `unsubscribeTag(tagName, obj)` | remove a tag subscriber (e.g. a `<closure-lightbox>` on disconnect) |
| `dispatchTags(tags)`         | invoked by `ClosureResponse` to deliver the elements its subscribers requested |
| `loadContent(html)`          | replace inner HTML, re-resolve templates and forms, re-arm dirty / submit hooks |
| `cleanDirty(templates)`      | clear dirty flag — `"*"` for all, or `"a,b"` |

## Events

| Event | Bubbles | Cancelable | Detail |
|---|---|---|---|
| `closure-response-notify` | no | no | `{ html, ok, status, role }` — fired on the closure by `<closure-template>` after **every** settled response (`ok` true/false); the only exception is a closure detached mid-flight (see `closure-ghost-response`) |
| `closure-fetch-error` | yes | yes | `{ url, error, message }` — a **captured** submit / anchor fetch failed at the network level |
| `closure-ghost-response` (fired on `document`) | — | yes | `{ html, …, source }` — a response arrived for a closure/template **detached mid-flight**. Discarded by default; **`preventDefault()` to process it anyway**. Also fired by `<closure-template>` |

(Native `beforeunload` is hooked when at least one template inside
declares `<template-lock-dirty block-unload>` — see below.)

### Captured GET forms

A captured `method="GET"` form follows native HTML semantics: the form data
**replaces** any query string already on the `action` (it is not appended). So
`<form method="GET" action="/search?tipo=admin">` submitting `q=juan` requests
`/search?q=juan`, not `/search?tipo=admin&q=juan` — matching what the browser
would do natively. (Captured anchors keep their `href` query intact.)

Add **`preserve`** to the form to opt out and **keep** the action's existing
query, appending the form data instead (`/search?tipo=admin&q=juan`) — for the
cases where the `action` carries fixed params you want to retain.

### Network errors on captured fetches

When a captured form submit or anchor click (`capture-inner-content`) fails
at the **network** level, the closure does **not** replace its body — doing
so would destroy the user's half-filled form. Instead it dispatches a
cancelable `closure-fetch-error` event and leaves the DOM untouched, so the
action stays retryable.

**The error policy is yours to define.** Listen for the event and show a
toast, open a `<closure-lightbox>`, offer a retry, or ignore it — the
component imposes nothing. Call `preventDefault()` to signal you handled it;
otherwise the closure logs the error to the console as a fallback.

```js
myClosure.addEventListener('closure-fetch-error', (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();                  // take over — suppress the console fallback
  showToast('Network error — please retry', e.detail.message);
});
```

> **Note:** this covers only **network-level** failures (the `fetch`
> rejected). An HTTP error *response* (4xx/5xx) that carries a body — e.g.
> server-rendered validation HTML — is still rendered into the closure as
> before; that path is unchanged.

## Inner declarative elements

Most of the workflow is configured via children. The reference for
each lives next to its component:

| Tag | Where to read more |
|---|---|
| `<closure-template>` and its children | see [`<closure-template>`](#closure-template) |
| `<closure-btn>`, `<closure-btn-item>` | see those entries — buttons fire roles handled by templates |
| `<closure-lightbox>`                  | uses `subscribeTag` to claim `<lightbox-response-item>` |

For brevity, only the closure-specific bits are listed here.

### Buttons inside a closure

| Attribute | Effect |
|---|---|
| `ct-role="x"`           | match the `<template-url>` / `<template-section>` whose `ct-role` is `x` |
| `closure-template="x"`  | aim a specific `<closure-template name="x">` (default: the first template) |

Without `ct-role`, the default `<template-url>` (and ct-role-less items)
are used.

### Dirty-state automation

| Element | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `<template-lock-dirty>` (inside a `<closure-template>`)   | control beforeunload blocking and per-role dirty filters |
| `<template-dirty-clean>` (inside a `<closure-template>`)  | declare when the dirty flag is cleared (on `result="ok"` or `result="always"`) and which templates to clean (`"*"` or `"a,b"`) |

`<template-lock-dirty>` accepts:

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| `block-unload`     | hook `beforeunload` to confirm navigation when dirty |
| `message="x"`      | message text (browsers usually ignore custom strings now, but the prompt fires) |
| `ct-role="x"`      | only block when this role's template is dirty |
| `ignore`           | explicitly do **not** block for this role |

## Example

```html
<target-closure name="user-edit" group-behavior="combine-sections">
  <closure-template name="save">
    <template-url url="/admin/users/save" method="POST"
                  response-lightbox-id="result"></template-url>
    <template-section section="profile" mode="prefix"></template-section>
    <template-section section="prefs"   mode="json" name="prefs_json"></template-section>
    <template-field name="csrf" dyn-value-id="csrf-token"></template-field>
    <template-lock-dirty block-unload></template-lock-dirty>
    <template-dirty-clean result="ok" templates="save"></template-dirty-clean>
  </closure-template>

  <form closure section="profile">…</form>
  <form closure section="prefs">…</form>

  <btn-grid>
    <closure-btn ct-role="save" class="primary">Save</closure-btn>
    <closure-btn ct-role="cancel">Cancel</closure-btn>
  </btn-grid>

  <span dirty-show="show">●</span>
</target-closure>
```

## Behaviour

> **Note:** `subscribeTag` is the extension point for new
> response-driven elements. `<closure-lightbox>` uses it to receive
> `<lightbox-response-item>` from the server without
> `ClosureResponse` needing to know about lightboxes. Subscribers must
> implement `onClosureTag(tagName, element)`.

> **Note:** `_setReadonly` propagates the read-only state through all
> familiar field types — text inputs (`readOnly`), checkboxes / radios
> / selects (`disabled`), `credential-pwd`, `closure-checkbox-tree`,
> `closure-checkbox-group` and `fingerprint-hands`. Use
> `<template-edit-mode readonly section="…">` (or `section="*"`) inside
> a `<closure-template>` to declare this lock at markup time.

> **Note:** `loadContent(html)` rewires every template and form inside
> after replacing HTML, so server-pushed bodies (e.g. lightbox results)
> stay fully reactive.

> **Note:** captured submits / anchor clicks (`capture-inner-content`)
> are guarded against re-entry — while one fetch is open a second
> capture is ignored, so a fast double-click can't fire duplicate
> requests. (Template-routed posts have their own equivalent guard.)

> **Ghost responses.** A `fetch` resolves even if the closure (or template)
> was removed from the DOM while the request was in flight — a SPA navigating
> away, a container replaced by another response. Because `ClosureResponse`
> mutates the **live, global** DOM (`getElementById` / `querySelector`),
> processing a dead component's response could pop a lightbox or redirect out
> of nowhere. So the default is to **discard** it. To override, listen on
> `document` for `closure-ghost-response` and `preventDefault()` — the
> response is then processed as usual (use this if a late redirect / side
> effect must still apply). `detail` carries the `html` and the originating
> element as `source`.
>
> ```js
> document.addEventListener('closure-ghost-response', (e) => {
>   if (shouldStillApply(e.detail)) e.preventDefault(); // process it anyway
> });
> ```

# `<closure-template>`

Declarative submission spec for a `<target-closure>`. Holds the URL,
HTTP method, send behaviour, sections to package, hidden fields and
response handling for one or more button roles. Lives inside the
closure as a markup-only element (`display: none`) and is invoked by
the closure when a `<closure-btn>` fires.

Multiple templates may live inside one closure. The button's
`closure-template="…"` and `ct-role="…"` attributes pick which one
runs and which `<template-url>` / `<template-section>` set applies.

Think of it as the **recipe a `<closure-btn>` follows when it fires**: where to
POST, how to package the closure's forms, and what to do with the response — all
declared in markup instead of JavaScript, so a `<target-closure>` can run a
server workflow without a full page reload. It does not send binary uploads:
every field is repackaged into hidden inputs / JSON, so a file input needs a
native `<form enctype="multipart/form-data">` outside the closure flow.

## Attributes (on `<closure-template>`)

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| `name="x"`                | template identity (matched by `closure-btn`'s `closure-template` attr) |
| `send-behavior="x"`       | `submit` (default) \| `submit-xform` \| `fetch` \| `fetch-json` \| `fetch-xform` |
| `parse="closure-response"`| pipe responses through `ClosureResponse` |
| `delegate-response`       | hand the response to the surrounding container (e.g. `<closure-lightbox>`) instead of writing it inline |

`submit-json` is intentionally **not** supported — there is no browser
enctype that produces a JSON body via form submit.

> **Note:** binary file uploads are **not** transported. The template
> repackages every field into a hidden-input form (and, in `fetch*` modes,
> URL-encodes or JSON-stringifies it), so an `<input type="file">` is
> serialized like any other field: the server receives the literal string
> `"[object File]"` as its value — never the file contents. That value is
> a reliable sentinel for "no real file was sent". Use a native
> `<form enctype="multipart/form-data">` outside the closure flow for
> actual uploads.

## Child elements

### `<template-url>` — destination

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| `url="…"`                  | static URL |
| `dyn-url-id="id"`          | element whose value is read at submit time as the URL |
| `method="POST"`            | HTTP method (default `POST`) |
| `ct-role="x"`              | only applies when the firing button has this `ct-role` |
| `switch="<id> == v"`       | guard: only applies when the referenced control has this value (`!=` also supported) |
| `response-target-id="id"`  | element to receive the response body |
| `response-target-ok-id`    | overrides `response-target-id` on success |
| `response-target-fail-id`  | overrides `response-target-id` on failure |
| `response-lightbox-id`     | lightbox to receive `showResponse` / `showError` |
| `response-lightbox-ok-id`  | overrides on success |
| `response-lightbox-fail-id`| overrides on failure |
| `send-behavior="x"`        | per-role override of the template-level send-behavior |

URL resolution order: per-role `<template-url>` (dyn first, then static)
→ default `<template-url>` (dyn first, then static) → current page URL.

### `<template-section>` — data packaging

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| `from-form="formName"` | name of the source form (matched against `<form name="…">`) |
| `name="x"`             | section key applied to fields when packaging |
| `mode="flat\|prefix\|json\|json-multi"` | how to flatten the section into the outgoing form |
| `prefix="x"`           | override the section name as the prefix (only with `mode="prefix"`) |
| `no-prefix`            | flatten without any prefix |
| `separator="x"`        | character between prefix and field (default `_`) |
| `switch="<id> == v"`   | guard (same syntax as `<template-url>`) |

### `<template-field>` — extra hidden fields

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| `name="x"`           | hidden input name |
| `value="x"`          | static value |
| `dyn-value-id="id"`  | read value from another element at submit time |
| `switch="<id> == v"` | guard |

### `<template-loading>` — placeholder while in-flight

Inner HTML written into `response-target-*` while the request is open.
Cleared automatically when the response arrives.

### `<template-response-ok>` — success template

Inner HTML rendered into the response target on success.
Supports `{{code}}` and `{{text}}` substitutions for the HTTP status.

Add `target="id"` to render into a specific element. That target **wins**
over `response-target-id` / `response-target-ok-id`, which act only as the
**fallback** — the body is never injected into two places at once.

### `<template-response-fail>` — failure template

Inner HTML rendered on failure. Selected by best-match:

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| `type="network\|http\|parse"` | match a specific failure family |
| `code="404"`                   | match a specific HTTP status |
| (none)                         | catch-all |

### `<template-lock-dirty>` / `<template-dirty-clean>`

Declarative dirty-state automation. Run after a request completes to
mark or clean the closure's dirty templates without code.

## Public methods

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `execute(role, forms, submittedForm, btnData)` | invoked by `<target-closure>` for the firing button |

## Behaviour

> **Note:** repeated field names (a checkbox group, `<select multiple>`)
> are **preserved**, not collapsed to the last value. In `fetch-json` they
> become a JSON **array** (`"roles":["admin","editor"]`); in `flat` /
> `prefix` packaging and `submit` / `fetch` modes they stay as multiple
> `name=…` pairs, matching native form encoding.

> **Note:** after a request the template dispatches a `closure-response-notify`
> event on the enclosing `<target-closure>` (via `_notifyClosure`), with detail
> `{ html, ok, status, role }` — `bubbles: false`. (Named to avoid clashing with
> the `<closure-response>` **element** the server sends, which is the opposite
> direction.) With `delegate-response` set it does **not** insert the response
> into a target at all and relies on this event, letting the lightbox or another
> container render the body itself.

> **Note:** having **no** destination (no `response-target*`, no
> `<template-response-ok/fail target>`, no `response-lightbox*`) is legitimate —
> e.g. a fire-and-forget save, server-driven `<closure-response>` directives that
> place content themselves, `delegate-response`, or handling everything from the
> `closure-response-notify` event. Nothing is lost: that event always carries the
> body (`detail.html`) and outcome (`detail.ok`) for both success and failure.

> **Note:** when no `<template-section>` is declared and a
> `submittedForm` is passed in (e.g. a native form submit captured by
> `<target-closure>`), `execute` packages **its** fields verbatim
> instead of inventing sections.

> **Note:** `<template-section>` is what declares **how gathered forms are
> packaged** — `group-behavior` only decides *which* forms are collected.
> So a button-triggered submit that gathers forms (`combine-sections` /
> `combine-children`) but declares **no** `<template-section>` sends only the
> button payload (`data-*`); the gathered forms' fields are **not** packaged.
> This is by design, but `execute` emits a `console.warn` in that case so the
> missing declaration doesn't read as silent data loss. To **silence it on
> purpose without changing behaviour**, declare an **empty** `<template-section>`:
> it packages into a name-less hidden input (which is never serialized), so
> nothing extra is sent — it just acknowledges the intent. Give the section a
> `name="x"` or `standalone-inputs` when you actually want the gathered fields
> sent.

> **Note:** the `ct-role` resolution always prefers a role-specific
> child (`<template-url ct-role="approve">`) over the catch-all
> (`<template-url>`). If the role-specific child has a `switch` guard
> that fails, the resolver does **not** fall through to the catch-all
> automatically — author guards accordingly.

# `<closure-btn>`

Action button for the target-closure system. Renders a styled anchor
inside a shadow DOM. By default a click dispatches a bubbling
`btn-action` event that the enclosing `<target-closure>` picks up to
route the request to the matching `<closure-template>`. With the `menu`
attribute it becomes a dropdown that hosts `<closure-btn-item>` children.

Reach for it as the **action trigger** of a `<target-closure>` workflow: a click
emits the bubbling `btn-action` event and the closure routes the request to the
matching `<closure-template>`; with `menu` it instead opens a panel of
`<closure-btn-item>` actions. It is not a general-purpose `<button>` for
arbitrary scripting — its job is to fire a *routed* closure action (or a menu of
them); button state and form validation stay with the surrounding closure / form.

## Attributes

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| `ct-role="x"`           | role used to match a `<closure-template>` template URL / response |
| `closure-template="x"`  | name of a specific `<closure-template>` to invoke |
| `icon="x"`              | icon text rendered above/before the label |
| `label="x"`             | tooltip text used together with `nolabel` |
| `width="x"`             | fixed visual button width (`28` means `28px`; CSS lengths pass through) |
| `nolabel`               | hide the label, show only the icon (tooltip = `label` or `menu`) |
| `notooltip`             | when `nolabel`, suppress the tooltip |
| `menu="x"`              | turn the button into a dropdown; `x` is the panel header text |
| `disabled`              | disabled visual + non-interactive (also `disabled="true"`/`""`) |
| `readonly`              | rendered but hidden (used to keep grid alignment) |
| `class="primary\|red\|green\|gray\|small"` | colour / size variants |
| `free`                  | bypass target-closure: click POSTs to `url` (or fires the event itself) |
| `url="x"`               | (with `free`) destination URL of the auto-generated form |
| `get` / `post` / `method="get\|post"` | (with `free`) pick the submit method — quick boolean attributes win over `method=`. Default: **POST** (an action button). On GET the `data-*` fields become the query string, replacing any query on `url` (add `preserve` to keep it) |
| `event="x"`             | event name to dispatch (default `btn-action`) |
| `target-id="x"`         | element to receive the dispatched event (default: self) |
| `target-selector="css"` | selector target for local client actions |
| `target-selector-all="css"` | selector targets for local client actions |
| `section="x"`           | section key when packaging `data-*` for the closure |
| `data-*`                | included in `getBtnData()`'s payload section |

## Events

| Event | Bubbles | Cancelable | Detail |
|---|---|---|---|
| `btn-action` (or custom `event`) | yes | no | none |

`<target-closure>` reads the button's `getBtnData()` to extract
`ct-role`, `closure-template` and `data-*` fields when handling the event.

## Methods

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `getBtnData()` | `{ ctRole, closureTemplate, sections: { [section]: { …data-* fields } } }` |

## Example

```html
<!-- Standard target-closure button -->
<closure-btn ct-role="save" icon="💾" class="primary" data-id="42">
  Save
</closure-btn>

<!-- Free-mode: posts data-* to /logout -->
<closure-btn free url="/logout" class="red">
  Sign out
</closure-btn>

<!-- Dropdown menu -->
<closure-btn menu="Actions" icon="⋯">
  <closure-btn-item ct-role="export" icon="📥">Export</closure-btn-item>
  <closure-btn-item ct-role="archive" icon="🗄️">Archive</closure-btn-item>
</closure-btn>
```

## Local client actions

`client-action="set-value"` writes `value` to the resolved target's
`.value` property without a server round trip and without dispatching
the normal `btn-action` event. It **does** fire `input` and `change`
(bubbling) on each target afterwards, so dirty-state tracking and other
listeners react as if the user had edited the field.

```html
<input id="year" type="text">

<closure-btn client-action="set-value" target-id="year" value="2026" class="small">
  2026
</closure-btn>
```

Targets can be selected with `target-id`, `target-selector`, or
`target-selector-all`. This mirrors the server-side
`<response-item type="set-value">` action, but runs entirely in the
browser.

## CSS Variables

Consumed for styling the inner anchor (every value falls back if unset):

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--form-btn-host-display`   | `block`              | host `display` |
| `--form-btn-min-height`     | `100px`              | host minimum height |
| `--form-btn-padding`        | `10px 20px`          | inner padding |
| `--form-btn-font-size`      | `14px`               | label font size |
| `--form-btn-radius`         | `6px`                | border radius |
| `--form-btn-bg`             | `var(--primary,#4f46e5)` | background |
| `--form-btn-color`          | `#fff`               | text colour |
| `--form-btn-shadow`         | `none`               | resting shadow |
| `--form-btn-shadow-hover`   | `none`               | hover shadow |
| `--form-btn-direction`      | `column`             | flex direction inside the anchor |
| `--form-btn-icon-size`      | `2.4em`              | icon font size |
| `--form-btn-icon-display`   | `block`              | icon span display (`btn-grid no-icon` sets `none`) |
| `--form-btn-width`          | `100%`               | anchor width |
| `--form-btn-height`         | `auto`               | anchor height |

Class variants apply built-in colours and sizes:
`primary`, `red`, `green`, `gray`, `small`.

## Behaviour

> **Note:** the dropdown panel re-positions itself with `position: fixed`
> and clamps to the viewport with an 8px margin so it never overflows the
> screen. On widths ≤ 600px it switches to a centered modal layout.

> **Note:** Enter on the host activates the anchor; Space also activates
> when in `menu` mode. Arrow Up/Down + Enter move focus through items;
> Esc closes the panel.

> **Note:** `readonly` keeps the host laid out (visibility: hidden) so it
> still occupies the grid cell. Use `disabled` if you want the button
> visually present but inactive.

# `<closure-btn-item>`

Menu item for the `<closure-btn menu="…">` dropdown. Behaves like a
mini-button: clicking it dispatches the same action event as its parent
button (or POSTs to its own `url`), inheriting fields the user did not
override.

## Attributes

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| `ct-role="x"`   | role for template matching (overrides the parent button's `ct-role`) |
| `icon="x"`      | icon text rendered before the label |
| `disabled`      | disabled visual + skips focus |
| `url="x"`       | when set, click submits the merged `data-*` to this URL (shared `closureFreeSubmit()` form) instead of dispatching the event. Default method: **POST**; `get`/`post`/`method=` pick another, as on `<closure-btn free>` |
| `event="x"`     | event name to dispatch (defaults to parent's `event` then to `btn-action`) |
| `target-id="x"` | element to receive the dispatched event (defaults to parent's `target-id` then to the parent button) |
| `section="x"`   | section key when packaging `data-*` (defaults to parent's `section`) |
| `data-*`        | merged on top of parent's `data-*` (item wins on conflicts) |

## Methods

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `getBtnData()` | merged payload `{ ctRole, closureTemplate, sections: { [section]: { …data-* } } }` |

## Example

```html
<closure-btn menu="Row actions" icon="⋯">
  <closure-btn-item ct-role="edit"   icon="✎" data-id="42">Edit</closure-btn-item>
  <closure-btn-item ct-role="delete" icon="🗑" data-id="42" class="red">Delete</closure-btn-item>
</closure-btn>
```

## CSS Variables

Consumed (with fallbacks):

| Variable | Default |
|---|---|
| `--btn-item-gap`        | `10px` |
| `--btn-item-padding`    | `10px 16px` |
| `--btn-item-font-size`  | `14px` |
| `--font`                | `sans-serif` |
| `--text`                | `#111827` |
| `--primary`             | `#4f46e5` |
| `--primary-light`       | `#e0e7ff` |

## Behaviour

> **Note:** the cascading data merge means the parent button's `data-*`
> attributes apply to **every** item by default. An item can shadow any
> single field by re-declaring `data-<name>` on itself.

> **Note:** when `url` is set, the inner anchor builds and submits a
> hidden form with the merged section-prefixed fields. This bypasses
> `<target-closure>` entirely — useful for "free" actions like signing
> out from inside a dropdown.

---

# `<closure-lightbox>`

Native `<dialog>`-based modal that hosts a `<target-closure>` body.
Uses `display: contents` so the host doesn't take layout space — the
inner `<dialog>` is what the user sees. After connect, any
`<target-closure>` child is moved into the dialog body and the lightbox
subscribes to its `<lightbox-response-item>` tag so the server can
control title and open/close declaratively.

## Attributes

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| `title="x"` | initial dialog title |

## Methods

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `open({ title?, content?, buttons? })`        | open dialog; optionally set title, content, footer buttons |
| `close(action?)`                              | close with the given `action` (default `"close"`) |
| `setTitle(html)`                              | replace the title (HTML allowed) |
| `setContent(html)`                            | replace the body (routes through the inner closure when present) |
| `showResponse(html)`                          | set body + open; fires cancelable `lb-response` first. **Returns `true` if it opened, `false` if a listener cancelled it** (so a caller that created the lightbox can remove it instead of leaking the node) |
| `showError(html)`                             | set body + open; fires cancelable `lb-error` first. Returns `true`/`false` like `showResponse` |
| **static** `MsgAlert(msg, title?)`            | spawn a one-OK alert lightbox; auto-removes on close |
| **static** `MsgConfirm(msg, title?)`          | spawn an OK/Cancel lightbox; resolves a Promise → `true` (OK) / `false` |

## Events

| Event | Bubbles | Cancelable | Detail |
|---|---|---|---|
| `lb-close`     | no | no  | `{ action }` |
| `lb-response`  | no | yes | `{ html }` |
| `lb-error`     | no | yes | `{ html }` |

`action` is one of `"close"` (X button), `"cancel"` (Esc), `"server"`
(closed by a `<lightbox-response-item type="close">`), `"timeout"` (auto
delay close), `"ok"` (alert/confirm OK), or any custom value passed to
`close()` / declared on a footer button.

## Subscribed closure tags

`<lightbox-response-item>`:

| Attribute | Effect |
|---|---|
| `title="x"`     | replace title (text) |
| `title-html="x"`| replace title (HTML) |
| `type="open"`   | show the dialog |
| `type="close"`  | close, with `action` (default `"server"`) |
| `type="delay"`  | auto-close after `ms` (action `"timeout"`) |

## Example

```html
<closure-lightbox title="Edit user">
  <target-closure name="edit">
    <closure-template>…</closure-template>
    <form closure>…</form>
  </target-closure>
</closure-lightbox>

<script>
  // Server-style usage
  document.querySelector('closure-lightbox').showResponse(html);

  // Programmatic confirm
  ClosureLightbox.MsgConfirm('Delete user 42?').then(ok => {
    if (ok) doDelete();
  });
</script>
```

## CSS Variables

Consumed (with fallbacks):

| Variable | Default |
|---|---|
| `--border`     | `#e5e7eb` |
| `--bg`         | `#f9fafb` |
| `--text`       | `#111827` |
| `--text-muted` | `#6b7280` |
| `--font`       | `sans-serif` |
| `--radius`     | `8px` |
| `--primary`    | `#4f46e5` |
| `--red`        | `#dc2626` |

## Behaviour

> **Note:** the dialog is built once on connect and the inner
> `<target-closure>` is *moved* into it. After that, calling
> `setContent()` / `showResponse()` writes through the closure's
> `loadContent()` so its template / form bindings stay intact.

> **Note:** `showResponse` / `showError` events are **cancelable** —
> a listener that calls `preventDefault()` blocks both the body update
> and the `showModal()` call. Useful for client-side validation gates.

> **Note:** Esc fires the dialog's `cancel` event which the lightbox
> intercepts and closes with `action: "cancel"`. The browser's default
> Esc-closes-dialog behaviour is suppressed so the close path is uniform.

# `<closure-lazy-iframe>`

Collapsible iframe panel. Renders a header with a label and an
expand/collapse chevron button; the body hosts an `<iframe>` whose
`src` is **only assigned the first time the panel is expanded** — until
then no frame exists and the embedded page costs nothing. The panel
starts collapsed unless the `expanded` attribute is present.

The iframe stretches to the panel body: give the host (or its
container) a height and the frame fills it; with no explicit height the
body falls back to `--lazy-iframe-height` (320px). Collapsing only
hides the body — the loaded document stays alive, so re-expanding is
instant. Call `unload()` to actually drop the frame.

Light-DOM children are slotted into the body as a placeholder and stay
visible until the iframe fires its first `load` (default placeholder:
"Loading…").

## Attributes

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| `label="x"`   | header label |
| `src="url"`   | iframe URL — assigned on first expand |
| `expanded`    | boolean; present = open. Reflected: toggle it to open/close |
| `iframe-title="x"` | copied to the iframe's `title` (accessibility) |
| `data-*` / `section="x"` | form fields (`section_`-prefixed when `section` is set): when present, loading goes through a hidden form (shared `closureFreeSubmit()`) submitted **into** the named frame with the applicable method — GET (default): the fields become the frame url's query string; POST: they travel in the body. Without fields (and without `post`) the `src` is simply assigned |
| `post` / `method="post"` | use **POST** for the frame-targeted form. For heavy server-generated reports whose parameters don't belong in a URL |
| `name`, `allow`, `sandbox`, `referrerpolicy`, `allowfullscreen` | copied verbatim to the iframe when it is created. In `post` mode the frame needs a `name` — an internal one is generated if the attribute is absent |

## Methods / properties

| Member | Description |
|---|---|
| `expand()` / `collapse()` / `toggle()` | change panel state (sets/removes `expanded`) |
| `unload()`          | collapse and remove the iframe; the next expand re-creates it and reloads `src` |
| `expanded` (getter) | `true` while expanded |
| `loaded` (getter)   | `true` once the iframe exists (src assigned) |
| `iframe` (getter)   | the inner `<iframe>` element, or `null` before first expand / after `unload()` |

## Events

| Event | Bubbles | Cancelable | Detail |
|---|---|---|---|
| `lzi-toggle` | no | no  | `{ expanded }` |
| `lzi-load`   | no | yes | `{ src }` — fired before the iframe is created; `preventDefault()` expands the panel without loading (the next expand retries) |
| `lzi-loaded` | no | no  | `{ src }` — the iframe fired its `load` event |

## Example

```html
<!-- collapsed by default: the report only loads when the user expands -->
<closure-lazy-iframe label="Sales report" src="/reports/sales.html">
  <p>The report loads when you expand this panel.</p>  <!-- placeholder -->
</closure-lazy-iframe>

<!-- starts open, loads immediately -->
<closure-lazy-iframe label="Map" src="https://maps.example.com/embed" expanded></closure-lazy-iframe>

<!-- POST-loaded report: params travel as form fields, not in the URL -->
<closure-lazy-iframe label="Annual report" src="/reports/annual"
                     post data-year="2026" data-scope="all"></closure-lazy-iframe>

<script>
  var panel = document.querySelector('closure-lazy-iframe');
  panel.addEventListener('lzi-loaded', function(e) {
    console.log('frame ready:', e.detail.src);
  });
  panel.expand();   // same as panel.setAttribute('expanded', '')
</script>
```

## CSS Variables

Consumed (with fallbacks):

| Variable | Default |
|---|---|
| `--lazy-iframe-height` | `320px` (body height when the host has none) |
| `--lazy-iframe-bg` | `#fff` (body background) |
| `--border`     | `#e5e7eb` |
| `--bg`         | `#f9fafb` |
| `--text`       | `#111827` |
| `--text-muted` | `#6b7280` |
| `--font`       | `sans-serif` |
| `--radius`     | `8px` |

## Behaviour

> **Note:** the `expanded` attribute is the single source of truth:
> `expand()` / `collapse()` / the header click only set or remove it and
> the attribute callback does the work (show/hide via `:host([expanded])`
> CSS, lazy load, events). Server-rendered markup can therefore open the
> panel by simply including the attribute.

> **Note:** the host is a flex column: when the container gives it a
> height, the body (and iframe) stretch to fill it; otherwise the body
> takes `--lazy-iframe-height`. The frame always fills the body 100%.

> **Note:** changing `src` after the iframe exists writes through and
> navigates the frame; changing it before first expand just updates
> what will be loaded. When loading goes through the form (fields
> present, or `post`), the write-through **re-submits** with the
> current `data-*` values; on POST, `unload()` + expand re-POSTs —
> inherent to POST navigation, as is the browser's confirm on a manual
> frame reload.

> **Note:** an initial `expanded` set in markup fires its `lzi-*` events
> during upgrade, before page scripts can typically listen — read the
> `expanded` / `loaded` properties instead of relying on those events.

# `<closure-dashboard>`

Dashboard shell: a fixed header (hamburger + linked title + free tool
area), a collapsible side navigation panel, and a client area that is
the only scroll container. One global control, declarative child tags:

```html
<closure-dashboard label="My App" logo-href="/">
  <dash-header>
    <clock-display small dot></clock-display>
  </dash-header>
  <dash-nav>
    <dash-nav-group label="Tracking">
      <dash-nav-item name="home" panel="home" selected>Home</dash-nav-item>
      <dash-nav-item name="reports" url="/dash/reports" panel="reports" badge="3">Reports</dash-nav-item>
    </dash-nav-group>
    <dash-nav-item name="about" url="/dash/about" lightbox>About</dash-nav-item>
    <dash-nav-item href="/help">Help</dash-nav-item>
    <hr>
    <form action="/search"><input name="q" placeholder="Search…"></form>
  </dash-nav>
  <dash-client>
    <p>Default region — shown when no panel item is selected.</p>
    <dash-panel name="home">…</dash-panel>
  </dash-client>
</closure-dashboard>
```

The layout is self-contained: the host is a flex column
(`--dash-height`, default `100dvh`), the header row never scrolls, and
`<dash-client>` scrolls on its own. No page CSS is ever needed; CSS
variables are optional restyling hooks.

**The closure machinery is opt-in, never required** (see the ladder
below): a dashboard of plain links, or of local panels, works with zero
`<target-closure>` involvement.

## Tags

| Tag | Role |
|---|---|
| `<closure-dashboard>` | the shell: layout, selection, fetch pipeline |
| `<dash-header>`       | free content, right-aligned in the fixed header |
| `<dash-nav>`          | the side panel: items, groups and free content (buttons, mini forms, `<hr>`…) |
| `<dash-nav-group>`    | titled, collapsible section of items (`label`, `collapsed`) |
| `<dash-nav-item>`     | a navigation entry (see modes below) |
| `<dash-client>`       | the client area; non-panel children form the *default region* |
| `<dash-panel>`        | named, state-preserving region of the client area |
| `<on-fetch-error>`    | declarative markup rendered into a failed, empty target — same vocabulary as the grid. As a direct child of a `<dash-panel>`: per-section error UI; as a direct child of `<dash-client>`: shell-wide. The panel-level one wins. Extracted at init, so a panel holding only its error template still counts as empty and fetches |

`<dash-header>`, `<dash-nav>`, `<dash-client>` and `<dash-panel>` are
plain declarative tags — the shell wires them; only
`<closure-dashboard>` is a custom element.

## `<closure-dashboard>` attributes

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| `label="x"`      | app title in the header |
| `logo-src="x"`   | logo image rendered before the label (or alone, with no `label`); height via `--dash-logo-height` |
| `logo-href="x"`  | make the title (logo + label) a link |
| `title-align="center"` | center the title/logo in the bar (absolute centering — unaffected by the hamburger or the `<dash-header>` tools). Default: left, after the hamburger |
| `collapsed`      | boolean, reflected — side nav hidden. Toggled by the hamburger; the single source of truth |
| `closure="name"` | optional: name of the `<target-closure>` that receives default-region loads (default: first one found in the region) |

## `<dash-nav-item>` — navigation out and in

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| `name="x"`   | identity for selection, `select(name)` and server directives |
| `href="x"`   | **out**: plain full navigation (GET) |
| `free`       | **out, form submit**: with `url`, the `<closure-btn free>` mode via the shared `closureFreeSubmit()` helper — the click builds a hidden form from the item's `data-*` (names prefixed by `section` when present), submits it and navigates to the response. Default method: **GET** (a nav item is navigation; fields → query string); write `post` for POST — `<dash-nav-item free post url="/logout">Sign out</dash-nav-item>`. `get`/`post`/`method=` as on `<closure-btn>` |
| `panel="x"`  | **in, no fetch**: show `<dash-panel name="x">`, hide the others; DOM state is preserved across switches |
| `url="x"`    | **in, fetch**: GET the url and render it — into the default region, or into the item's `panel` (first activation only; created if absent), or into `target`/`lightbox` below |
| `refresh`    | with `url`+`panel`: re-fetch on every activation, not just the first |
| `lazy`       | with `url`+`selected`: don't fetch on page load even if the target is empty — wait for the first real activation |
| `preload`    | with `url`+`panel`: the opposite of `lazy` — fetch at page load, in the background, into the still-hidden panel, so entering the section is instant |
| `target="sel"` | with `url`: render into the container matched by the CSS selector (looked up inside `<dash-client>` first, then document-wide) |
| `lightbox` / `lightbox="id"` | with `url`: show the response in a `<closure-lightbox>` (referenced by id, or a spawned throw-away one). Does **not** change the selection — it is an action, not a place |
| `selected`   | boolean, reflected — the active item |
| `badge="x"`  | counter/pill at the item's right edge (CSS-rendered) |
| `activate-on="event"` | activate this item whenever that `<signal-event>` name fires on `document` |
| `ct-role="x"` / `closure-template="x"` | **routed action mode** — the item inherits the `<closure-btn>` contract by duck typing: it switches place normally, then dispatches `btn-action` (itself as `detail.source`, exposing the standard `getBtnData()`) at the place's closure, which routes the POST through its `<closure-template>` and processes the response. The closure-native alternative to `url` — don't combine both on one item |
| `target-id="x"` | with `ct-role`: dispatch the `btn-action` at that element instead of the place's closure |
| `section="x"` / `data-*` | with `ct-role`: payload fields packaged by `getBtnData()`, exactly as on `<closure-btn>` |

Item content is light-DOM markup (text, an emoji/svg icon, `<b>`…).
Everything else inside `<dash-nav>` (buttons, forms, separators) is
rendered as free content: nav behavior applies only to items, and the
existing button/form machinery composes untouched:

- `<closure-btn free url="/x">` — the encapsulated POST form: click
  posts its `data-*` to the url (full navigation, "out").
- `<closure-btn ct-role="x" target-id="main">` — routed action "in":
  the `btn-action` is dispatched at a `<target-closure>` living in a
  panel/region, which posts through its template and processes the
  response there (directives, `<dashboard-response-item>`, signals).
- `<form closure="name">` — a mini form associated by name to a closure
  anywhere in the document; a plain `<form>` submits natively.

## Render targets and the opt-in ladder

Every rung is first-class; the next adds only what it names:

1. **Links only** (`href` items): classic multi-page app, zero JS semantics.
2. **Local panels** (`panel` items): everything travels in the initial
   page; switching preserves DOM state. Fully offline-capable.
3. **Fetch without closures** (`url` items): responses land via
   `innerHTML` in the default region / panel / `target` container.
4. **Closure mode**: if the receiving region, panel or container holds a
   `<target-closure>`, the response goes through `loadContent()` —
   templates, form association, dirty tracking and response directives
   come alive. Actions inside a panel scope to that panel's closure by
   plain nearest-closure association.

`url` **without** `panel` always re-fetches into the shared default
region. With `panel`, the fetch is lazy (first activation) and the
panel keeps its state; `refresh` re-fetches every time.

**When urls load** — a three-step eagerness scale, per item:

- **`preload`** (eager): fetched at page load, in the background, into
  its hidden panel. Requires `url`+`panel`.
- **default** (lazy): fetched on first activation. Exception: the
  initially `selected` item fetches at load when its target is empty
  (an auto-created panel) — a selected-but-empty landing would be
  useless. A panel (or the region) that carries server-rendered markup
  content counts as **loaded** and is not refetched, neither at load
  nor on first activation.
- **`lazy`** (explicit): suppresses even the selected-item exception —
  nothing loads until a real activation.

`refresh` is orthogonal and governs the **second and later**
activations: the first render (markup or first fetch) is fresh by
definition — `refresh` never causes a load-time refetch; it re-fetches
on every activation after that.

**Dirty protection:** an automatic (re)fetch never clobbers unsaved
edits. If the target's closure reports dirty state, the fetch is
skipped, the panel shows as-is (the edit lives), and `dash-dirty-skip`
fires — the app decides (ignore, confirm via `MsgConfirm`, or
`closure.cleanDirty('*')` + `select(name)` to force). The next
activation with a clean closure fetches normally.

**Closure responses:** rendering through a closure means
`loadContent()`, which runs `ClosureResponse.process()` — a fetched
`<closure-response>` document (directives, sections, subscribed tags)
is executed, not dumped as markup. In closure-less targets (ladder
rung 3) the response is plain HTML by design.

**Fetch failure handling** — the same ladder of options as the rest of
the library, most specific wins:

1. **Event** (programmatic): `dash-fetch-error` is cancelable —
   `preventDefault()` takes over completely (toast, `MsgAlert`, retry
   logic…) and suppresses everything below.
2. **Declarative markup**: an `<on-fetch-error>` direct child of the
   `<dash-panel>` (per-section), else of `<dash-client>` (shell-wide) —
   same vocabulary as `<closure-data-grid>` — supplies the HTML
   rendered into the failed target.
3. **Built-in notice**: with neither of the above, a never-**loaded**
   target (an auto-created panel, a bare region) shows a muted
   retryable notice. "Loaded" is the durable state set once — markup
   content counts at init; a successful fetch sets it — so the failure
   decision never has to sniff the DOM.
4. **Console**: the error is also logged (unless the event was
   prevented).

In every path the failed target is **not** marked loaded, so the next
activation retries; and a target holding real content is never touched
— an item with `refresh` whose re-fetches fail keeps showing the last
good content (the failure surfaces via the event / console, not by
destroying state).

## Methods / properties

| Member | Description |
|---|---|
| `select(name)` | activate the item programmatically (same pipeline as a click) |
| `collapse()` / `expand()` / `toggle()` | side nav visibility (sets/removes `collapsed`) |
| `selected` (getter) | `name` of the active item, or `''` |

## Events

| Event | Bubbles | Cancelable | Detail |
|---|---|---|---|
| `dash-nav`    | no | yes | `{ name, url }` — before activation; `preventDefault()` blocks it |
| `dash-loaded` | no | no  | `{ name, url }` — a fetch was rendered |
| `dash-toggle` | no | no  | `{ collapsed }` |
| `dash-fetch-error` | no | yes | `{ url, error, message }` — network-level fetch failure; `preventDefault()` takes over (suppresses the declarative/built-in error rendering and the console fallback). See "Fetch failure handling" below |
| `dash-dirty-skip` | no | no | `{ name, url }` — a (re)fetch was skipped because the target's closure is dirty (unsaved edits). Confirm + `cleanDirty()` + `select(name)` to force |

**Panel events**, fired on the `<dash-panel>` element itself so inner
content subscribes to its own ancestor without knowing names:

| Event | Detail |
|---|---|
| `panel-show`   | `{ name }` — the panel just became visible |
| `panel-hide`   | `{ name }` — the panel was switched away from |
| `panel-loaded` | `{ name, url }` — a `url`+`panel` fetch rendered into it |

## Signals (server → shell)

The shell listens on `document` for the well-known
`<signal-event name="dash-select" data-item="reports">` and runs the
full activation pipeline for that item. Additionally any item may
subscribe to a domain event via `activate-on="entry-created"` — the
server emits its domain signal without knowing item names; combined
with `refresh`, "dialog saved → section selected and fresh" is pure
markup. Listeners are armed at the deferred init (after
`DOMContentLoaded`), so signals arriving in server responses always
find them; a `<signal-event>` in the *initial static markup* may fire
too early to be heard.

## `<dashboard-response-item>` (subscribed closure tag)

When regions/panels hold closures, the shell subscribes this tag on
every closure it renders into — so any response can steer the shell:

| Attribute | Effect |
|---|---|
| `select="name"` | activate that item |
| `badge="name:value"` | set an item's badge (`value` empty ⇒ remove it) |
| `label="x"` | replace the header title |
| `type="collapse"` / `type="expand"` | drive the side nav |

## Example

See `examples/dashboard.html`. `url` items need the page served over
HTTP (`fetch` is blocked on `file://`); everything else works offline.

## CSS Variables

Premise: **CSS can be used, never needed.** Consumed (with fallbacks):
shared tokens `--border`, `--bg`, `--text`, `--text-muted`,
`--primary`, `--font`, `--radius`, plus:

| Variable | Default |
|---|---|
| `--dash-height`         | `100dvh` |
| `--dash-header-height`  | `48px` |
| `--dash-logo-height`    | `24px` |
| `--dash-nav-width`      | `220px` |
| `--dash-client-padding` | `16px` |
| `--dash-header-bg` / `--dash-nav-bg` | `var(--bg)` |
| `--dash-bg`             | `#fff` (host & client area background) |
| `--dash-selected-bg`    | `var(--primary)` |
| `--dash-selected-text`  | `#fff` |

## Behaviour

> **Note:** `collapsed` is the single source of truth for the side nav
> (like `expanded` on `<closure-lazy-iframe>`): the hamburger, the
> scrim and `collapse()`/`expand()` only set or remove the attribute.

> **Note:** below 880px (fixed breakpoint — CSS variables cannot drive
> media queries) the nav starts collapsed; expanded, it overlays the
> client area with a scrim, and picking an item auto-collapses it.

> **Note:** the shell moves `<dash-header>` into the header bar and
> wraps the non-panel children of `<dash-client>` in an internal
> default-region container at init (the same move-on-connect approach
> as `<closure-lightbox>`). Panels stay where they are.

> **Note:** panels and tabs compose — putting a `<closure-tab-bar>`
> inside a `<dash-panel>` is the expected pattern. The two mechanisms
> cannot collide: different tags (`dash-panel[active]` vs
> `closure-tab[active]`), tag-scoped CSS and distinct events
> (`panel-*` vs `tab-change`). Tabs initialize normally inside a hidden
> panel and keep their active tab across panel switches. The shell only
> manages `<dash-panel>` elements that are **direct children** of
> `<dash-client>` — nested or fragment-delivered lookalikes are content.

> **Note:** an HTTP error response (4xx/5xx) with a body is rendered
> like any other (matching `<target-closure>`); only network-level
> failures leave the DOM untouched and fire `dash-fetch-error`.

# `<closure-status-bar>`

Horizontal status bar that slots its children into a flex layout. Acts
as a colour preset host: each `type` value paints both the background
and border, and re-themes inner button defaults via `--form-btn-bg`.
The slotted children are typically `<label>`, `<status-msg>`,
`<status-part>`, `<status-kv>` and `<status-buttons>`.

Use it as a single themed strip to surface the **state of a workflow** — a result
message, a few key/value facts, and the actions that follow — kept visually
together via a `type` colour preset. It is purely presentational: it lays out and
themes whatever you slot into it (`<status-msg>`, `<status-kv>`, `<status-part>`,
`<status-buttons>`) but holds no state of its own; the content is driven from
outside, usually a closure response.

## Attributes

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| `type="primary"` | indigo |
| `type="info"`    | sky-blue |
| `type="success"` | green |
| `type="warning"` | amber |
| `type="danger"`  | red |
| `type="gray"`    | medium grey |
| `type="white"`   | white background |
| `type="default"` | (no attr) light grey |

## Children

Composable from these elements (each its own custom element):

| Tag | Role |
|---|---|
| `<label>`         | bold leading title cell (right-bordered) |
| `<status-msg>`    | flexible message slot with light styling |
| `<status-part>`   | flexible cell with `flex` / `padding` / `wr` / `layout` controls |
| `<status-kv>`     | uppercase-key + value pair |
| `<status-buttons>`| auto-laying button group |

## Example

```html
<closure-status-bar type="success">
  <label>Payroll</label>
  <status-msg>Posted 142 payslips</status-msg>
  <status-kv key="run">2026-05-02 17:21</status-kv>
  <status-buttons>
    <closure-btn ct-role="undo" class="small">Undo</closure-btn>
    <closure-btn ct-role="export" class="small">Export</closure-btn>
  </status-buttons>
</closure-status-bar>
```

## CSS Variables

Consumed (host-level):

| Variable | Default |
|---|---|
| `--text`   | `#111827` |
| `--border` | `#e5e7eb` |

Re-themed automatically by `type=...` attributes (background, border,
`--form-btn-bg`).

## Behaviour

> **Note:** the host uses `display: flex` with `align-items: stretch`,
> so each child fills the bar's full height. `<status-buttons>` and
> `<status-part>` propagate this height to their grandchildren via
> `--form-btn-height: 100%`.

> **Note:** styling for direct slotted `<label>` and `<status-msg>`
> children is injected once into the document head (id
> `closure-status-bar-label-style`) so it can target light-DOM elements
> outside the shadow root.

---

# `<status-msg>`

Message slot for `<closure-status-bar>`. Uses `display: contents` so it
contributes no box of its own — its children inherit the parent bar's
flex slot. Adds gentle shadow-DOM styling to slotted `<ul>`, `<ol>` and
`<p>` so multi-line messages stay readable inside the bar.

Use it to drop **prose or a list** — a sentence, a `<ul>` of validation errors —
into a status bar and keep it readable, without it grabbing its own flex cell. It
is a styling wrapper only — no controls, no state; for labelled facts use
`<status-kv>`, for buttons use `<status-buttons>`.

No attributes, no methods, no events.

## Example

```html
<closure-status-bar type="info">
  <label>Tip</label>
  <status-msg>
    <p>Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> to save.</p>
  </status-msg>
</closure-status-bar>
```

---

# `<status-part>`

Flexible cell inside `<closure-status-bar>`. Useful for arbitrary content
that doesn't fit `<status-msg>`, `<status-kv>` or `<status-buttons>`.
Inherits the bar's height and exposes layout presets.

Use it as the **catch-all cell** of a status bar for content that doesn't fit the
purpose-built `<status-msg>` / `<status-kv>` / `<status-buttons>` — a small custom
layout, stacked figures, an inline widget. It is a layout container only: it
sizes and arranges what you put in it but holds no state and adds no behaviour.

## Attributes

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| `flex="N"`             | flex grow factor (inline style) |
| `padding="x"`          | inline padding override |
| `wr="min,max"`         | width range (see [Helpers / `applyWidthRange`](#helpers)) |
| `border`               | right-border separator |
| `center`               | center the contents horizontally |
| `right`                | right-align the contents |
| `layout="stack"`       | column flex (label above value, etc.) |
| `layout="grid"`        | 2-column grid (e.g. label / value pairs) |
| `layout="flow"`        | wrap children; orphan-stretch via `stretch-priority` |
| `layout="text"`        | block layout, scrollable, for free prose |

Inside `layout="flow"`, any child with `stretch-priority="N"` may grow
to fill the trailing gap on the last row (lower N = stretches first).

## Example

```html
<status-part layout="grid">
  <small>Started</small><strong>09:00</strong>
  <small>Ended</small><strong>17:00</strong>
</status-part>

<status-part layout="flow">
  <span>tag-1</span>
  <span>tag-2</span>
  <span stretch-priority="0">filler tag</span>
</status-part>
```

## Behaviour

> **Note:** `layout="flow"` installs a `ResizeObserver`. On every resize
> it measures the children, identifies orphans on the last row (rows with
> fewer items than the row above) and stretches the orphan with the
> lowest `stretch-priority` to consume the trailing space. Items without
> the attribute are never stretched.

> **Note:** `wr` resolves through the shared `applyWidthRange()` helper
> in `closure_helper_functions.js` — same semantics as in `<status-kv>`
> and `<status-buttons>`.

---

# `<status-buttons>`

Auto-laying button group inside `<closure-status-bar>`. Picks the column
count that minimises empty cells, optionally stretches one button to
fill the trailing gap, and paints separator borders between cells.

Use it for the **action cluster of a status bar** when a handful of buttons
should pack tidily and reflow as the bar narrows, instead of being laid out by
hand. It only handles *placement* (column count, the optional stretch,
separators) — the buttons' look, labels and behaviour are their own; for a
free-standing button grid outside a status bar use `<btn-grid>`.

## Attributes

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| `flex="N"`           | flex grow factor (inline style) |
| `gap="x"`            | gap between buttons; bare numbers become px (default `2px`) |
| `wr="min,max"`       | width range (see [Helpers / `applyWidthRange`](#helpers)) |

## Children

Any button-like elements. Each child can opt in to stretching with:

| Attribute on child | Description |
|---|---|
| `stretch-priority="N"` | candidate for absorbing the trailing gap; lower N wins |

## Example

```html
<status-buttons gap="4">
  <closure-btn ct-role="approve" class="primary small">Approve</closure-btn>
  <closure-btn ct-role="reject"  class="red small">Reject</closure-btn>
  <closure-btn ct-role="defer"   class="small" stretch-priority="0">Defer</closure-btn>
</status-buttons>
```

## CSS Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--gap`     | `2px` | gap between buttons (mirrored from `gap` attribute) |
| `--border`  | `#e5e7eb` | colour of the inter-cell separators |

## Behaviour

> **Note:** the layout runs in two modes. **Mode 1**: all buttons fit
> in one row at their natural width — only adds left-border separators.
> **Mode 2**: too wide — picks the column count with the fewest empty
> cells (preferring more columns on ties), then stretches the
> highest-priority candidate to fill them. If no child has
> `stretch-priority`, the last button stretches by default.

> **Note:** stretching may also fail if the candidate's row can't
> accommodate the extra cells without pushing siblings to a new row;
> in that case the algorithm falls back to a non-stretching layout.

> **Note:** the reflow is throttled by `_lastW` — repeat
> `ResizeObserver` callbacks at the same width are no-ops.

---

# `<status-kv>`

Key / value pair for `<closure-status-bar>`. The key is rendered as an
uppercase, muted, fixed-width label; the value as the bar's normal text.
The original inner HTML of the host becomes the value content on connect.

Use it for a **single labelled fact** in a status bar — a timestamp, a count, an
id — where the label/value pairing should be styled consistently. It is
display-only: no editing, no interactivity; for actions use `<status-buttons>`,
for free-form content use `<status-part>`.

## Attributes

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| `key="x"`      | uppercase muted label on the left |
| `prefix="x"`  | fixed text before the value |
| `suffix="x"`  | fixed text after the value |
| `wr="min,max"` | width range (see [Helpers / `applyWidthRange`](#helpers)) |

## Properties

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
| `.value` (get/set) | text content of the value span |

## Example

```html
<status-kv key="user">jdoe</status-kv>
<status-kv key="run">2026-05-02 17:21</status-kv>
<status-kv key="D" prefix="range " suffix=" days">14</status-kv>

<script>
  document.querySelector('status-kv[key="user"]').value = 'admin';
</script>
```

## CSS Variables

| Variable | Default |
|---|---|
| `--text-muted` | `#6b7280` |
| `--text`       | `#111827` |
| `--border`     | `#e5e7eb` |

## Behaviour

> **Note:** on connect the host's existing innerHTML is **moved** into a
> `.kv-val` span. Subsequent writes to the host's `innerHTML` would
> overwrite both the key and value spans — use `.value` (or
> `querySelector('.kv-val').innerHTML`) to update.

---

# `<closure-filter-bar>`

Configurable filter UI: a chip strip showing the active values, a
"Filter" button that opens a `<closure-lightbox>` with the form, and an
optional list of one-click presets. Dispatches `filter-change` on the
configured target so a paired `<closure-data-grid>` (or any consumer)
can refetch.

Use it to give a grid or list a compact filter UI without scattering form
controls across the page: the form lives in a modal behind a single button, and
a chip strip keeps the active filters visible. It does not fetch or filter
anything itself — it only emits `filter-change` with the current values; you wire
that to a `<closure-data-grid>` (or your own fetch) to actually reload.

## Attributes

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| `target="id"`     | element to receive `filter-change` (default: self) |
| `icon="x"`        | trigger button icon (default `🔍`) |
| `label="x"`       | trigger button label (default `Filter`) |
| `dialog-title="x"`| lightbox header text |
| `cancel-label="x"`| cancel button text (default `Cancel`) |
| `apply-label="x"` | apply button text (default `Apply`) |

## Children

### `<filter-field>`

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| `name="x"`         | field key in the values object |
| `label="x"`        | display label |
| `type="select"`    | dropdown (default) |
| `type="checkbox"`  | checkbox |
| `type="text"`      | free text input |
| `options="a,b,c"`  | inline options for `select` |
| `map-data-id="id"` | populate options from a `<data-map>` (map-item: `value` / `label`) |
| `no-all`           | omit the leading "All" empty option |
| `placeholder="x"`  | placeholder for `type="text"` inputs (default `Search…`) |
| `default="x"`      | initial value seeded into the field on first build (opt-in; overridden by a programmatic `setValues()`) |

### `<filter-preset>`

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| `label="x"`         | preset chip label |
| `data-<field>="v"`  | values to apply when the preset is selected |
| `clear`             | preset that resets all fields |

### `<filter-set-value-btn>`

Small button rendered below the targeted filter field. It writes a value
into that input only; it does not apply the filter or close the
lightbox.

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| `target="field"` | filter field name to update |
| `label="x"`      | button text |
| `value="v"`      | value written to the field |

## Events

| Event | Bubbles | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| `filter-change` | no | `{ field: value, … }` — a `type="checkbox"` (multi-select) field is an **array** of selected values; `select` / `text` fields are strings. (Arrays avoid the "comma = multi-select" ambiguity, so text values may contain commas.) |

Fired on the configured target after Apply or after the user removes a
chip.

## Properties / Methods

| Member | Description |
|---|---|
| `.values` (get) | current filter values, normalised the same way as the `filter-change` detail (a `type="checkbox"` field is an **array**, others are strings) |
| `setValues(obj)`| programmatic update; refreshes chips and dispatches `filter-change` |

## Example

```html
<closure-filter-bar target="users-grid" dialog-title="Filter users">
  <filter-field name="status" label="Status"
                options="active,disabled,pending"></filter-field>
  <filter-field name="role"   label="Role"
                map-data-id="role-map"></filter-field>
  <filter-field name="search" label="Search"  type="text"></filter-field>
  <filter-set-value-btn target="search" label="Today" value="today"></filter-set-value-btn>

  <filter-preset label="Only active" data-status="active"></filter-preset>
  <filter-preset label="Reset" clear></filter-preset>
</closure-filter-bar>
```

## CSS Variables

| Variable | Default |
|---|---|
| `--border`        | `#e5e7eb` |
| `--primary`       | `#4f46e5` |
| `--primary-light` | `#e0e7ff` |
| `--red`           | `#dc2626` |
| `--text-muted`    | `#6b7280` |
| `--font`          | `sans-serif` |

## Behaviour

> **Note:** the bar is rendered with `display: contents` — it adds the
> chip strip + trigger button as siblings in the parent layout.
> Dropping it inside a `<status-msg>` slot uses a slightly different
> stylesheet (no padding / borders) so it integrates cleanly with a
> `<closure-status-bar>`.

> **Note:** the lightbox is appended to `<body>`, **not** kept as a
> child of the filter-bar. This avoids style leakage but means the
> filter-bar must remain in the document for the lightbox to reach it.

> **Note:** when both `options` and `map-data-id` are set, the data-map
> wins; the inline list is only used as fallback.

---

# `<closure-data-grid>`

Paginated data table that can take its rows from inline markup or from
a dynamic fetch. Renders a header, a scrollable body and pagination
controls. Selection and focus are tracked separately so consumers like
`<closure-row-viewer>` can react to either.

Use it whenever a server (or inline markup) owns a list and the page just needs
to **show, page and act on it**. The grid is display + interaction, not state:
it renders the rows it is given and emits `row-select` / `row-focus` for the
rest of the page to react to — the canonical pairing is a grid driving a
`<closure-row-viewer>` (master → detail), optionally fed by a `<filter-bar>`
through its `<query-param>`s. Inline mode suits data already on the page; dynamic
mode (`<query-definition>`) hands paging and filtering to the server.

It is **not** an editable spreadsheet: cells are not inputs and rows are not
mutated in place — row actions (`type="actions"`) fire closure directives or
templates, so every change round-trips through the server like the rest of the
library.

## Data sources

| Source | How |
|---|---|
| **Inline**  | `<g-row><g-col name="…">value</g-col></g-row>` children supply the rows |
| **Dynamic** | a `<query-definition url="…">` child (with optional `<query-param>` mappings) declares the request; refresh on demand |

Dynamic requests expect JSON by default. Set `response="g-row"` on
`<query-definition>` when the server returns `<g-row>` fragments.

## Children (configuration)

| Tag | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `<grid-col>`        | column definition (`name`, `label`, `width`, `align`, `fill`, `type`, `map-data-id`) |
| `<grid-key>`        | per-row identity (composed of one or more `name`s) |
| `<grid-footer-buttons>` | extra buttons in the pagination footer (`side="left|center|right"`) |
| `<grid-layout>`     | declarative container: hoists `page-size`, `min-rows`, `max-rows`, `scroll` onto the grid (child value wins over the host attribute) |
| `<query-definition>`| dynamic-mode endpoint and defaults |
| `<query-param>`     | maps an external value (filter, etc.) into a query parameter |
| `<on-no-results>`   | markup rendered when the result set is empty |
| `<on-fetch-error>`  | markup rendered on network / HTTP error |
| `<filter-preset>`   | apply a predefined filter set to the grid |

(See [child elements](#closure-data-grid-children) below for details.)

## Sizing attributes

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| `page-size="auto"` | sizes the grid to the available viewport height and derives row count from that height |
| `scroll="window\|continuous"` | scroll disposition (see note below); inferred when omitted |
| `fill-reserve="N"` | with `page-size="auto"`, reserve `N` pixels below the grid |
| `fill-reserve="selector"` | reserve the live height of the matched element and relayout when it resizes |
| `fill-stop="selector"` | stop the grid at the matched element's top edge and relayout when it resizes |

When `fill-reserve="N"` is used and the next sibling is a
`<closure-row-viewer>`, `N` is treated as a minimum and the viewer's live
height is also measured.

## Master/detail

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| `detail-of="gridId"` | apply a filter from the selected row of another grid |
| `detail-event="row-select"` | master event that triggers refresh (`row-select` by default) |
| `detail-rows="field.path"` | use an array already embedded in the selected master row instead of fetching |
| `detail-key="field"` | child filter field written from the selected master row |
| `detail-master-key="field"` | master row field to read; defaults to `detail-key` |

For separated requests, the master selection writes a filter in the
child. The child fetches exactly like any other `filter="fetch"` grid:

```html
<closure-data-grid id="shiftsGrid"
                   detail-of="masterDaysGrid"
                   detail-key="master_day_id"
                   filter="fetch">
  <query-definition url="/schedule/masterdays/sid:{{.Sid}}/" method="POST">
    <query-param name="action" value="shifts-grid-json"></query-param>
    <query-param name="master_day_id" bind="filter.master_day_id"></query-param>
  </query-definition>
</closure-data-grid>
```

If the server returns row markup instead of JSON:

```html
<query-definition url="/schedule/masterdays/sid:{{.Sid}}/" method="POST" response="g-row">
```

For bundled data, omit the query and point `detail-rows` at the array in
the selected row:

```html
<closure-data-grid id="shiftsGrid" detail-of="masterDaysGrid" detail-rows="shifts">
</closure-data-grid>
```

With `response="g-row"`, bundled child rows are represented with
`<g-detail>` inside the master row:

```html
<g-row>
  <g-col name="master_day_id">2401</g-col>
  <g-col name="date_str">Mon, May 11, 2026</g-col>
  <g-detail name="shifts">
    <g-row>
      <g-col name="day_work_shift_id">5001</g-col>
      <g-col name="workshift_name">Morning</g-col>
    </g-row>
  </g-detail>
</g-row>
```

For static rows that arrive in one flat list, use the same relation key.
The child applies the filter locally:

```html
<closure-data-grid id="shiftsGrid"
                   detail-of="masterDaysGrid"

    <g-col name="master_day_id">2401</g-col>

## Selection vs focus

| Action | Result | Event |
|---|---|---|
| Click / Tap | sets the **selected** row | `row-select` (detail: `{ row, index }`) |
| Arrow Up / Down | moves the **focused** row | `row-focus` (detail: `{ row, index }`) |
| Enter on focused | promotes focused → selected | `row-select` |

Selected and focused indexes can differ — useful for "previewing" with
the keyboard while the selection drives a side panel.

## Methods

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `refresh(opts)`        | reload data (`opts.goto = "<id>"` to scroll to a specific row after refresh) |
| `updateRow(data)`      | re-render the **selected** row in place from `data` (merged onto it) — no reload; no-op if nothing is selected |
| `.selectedRow` (getter)| the currently selected row object, or `null` |

## Events

| Event | Bubbles | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| `row-select` | yes | `{ row, index }` |
| `row-focus`  | yes | `{ row, index }` |
| `filter-change` (handled, not fired) | — | accepted from a paired `<closure-filter-bar>` |
| `refresh` (handled, not fired) | — | reloads the grid; `detail` is passed to `refresh()` (e.g. `goto`). Fired *at* the grid by id (`dispatch-event` / `signal-event`) |
| `refresh-row` (handled, not fired) | — | re-renders the **selected** row from `detail` (a `data-row` JSON string, or the `data-*` fields). Ignores events bubbling from children |

## Refreshing after an edit

A common flow: a row is edited in a `<closure-lightbox>`, and on success the
server response refreshes the grid declaratively — no full page reload. Drive
it from the closure response: `dispatch-event` fires a `refresh` (whole grid)
or `refresh-row` (just the edited row) **at the grid by id**, carrying data via
`data-*` (stripped of `data-`, kept kebab-case — the same convention as button
payloads; **not** the `dataset` camel-casing).

```html
<!-- close the dialog, then re-render only the edited row from the new data -->
<closure-response>
  <response-item type="close-lightbox" target-id="editBox"></response-item>
  <response-item type="dispatch-event" event="refresh-row" target-id="usersGrid"
                 data-row='{"id":42,"name":"Ana","status":"approved"}'></response-item>
</closure-response>
```

Use `refresh` (with optional `data-goto`) instead when several rows may have
changed; `refresh-row` only touches the selected row. The same events also pair
with a delayed `<signal-event name="refresh" target-id="usersGrid" delay="…">`
for polling.

## Cell buttons

Columns with `type="btn"` render one or more `<closure-btn>` definitions
inside each row. The `bind` attribute still provides action payload
fields. These optional attributes control per-row presentation:

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| `show-bind="field"` | render the button only when `row[field]` is truthy and not `0` |
| `label-bind="field"` | visible button label from `row[field]` |
| `icon-bind="field"` | icon from `row[field]` |
| `title-bind="field"` | tooltip from `row[field]` |
| `width="x"` | fixed generated button width (`28` means `28px`; CSS lengths pass through) |
| `plain` / `plain-buttons` | render without the compact button frame |

When a `type="btn"` column has no explicit `grid-col width`, any
`width` declared on its child buttons contributes to the column's
auto-fit minimum width.

## Action menu columns

Columns with `type="actions"` render a compact menu button (`☰`) per row
that opens a dropdown of `<closure-btn-item>` actions:

```html
<grid-col label="" type="actions" width="44">
  <closure-btn-item icon="✎" data-action="edit"></closure-btn-item>
  <closure-btn-item icon="🗑" data-action="delete"></closure-btn-item>
</grid-col>
```

The dropdown uses the **HTML Popover API**, so it renders in the top
layer and is **not clipped** by the grid body's scroll container — the
menu on the last rows opens over the page instead of being cut off.
Outside-click / `Esc` dismissal and auto-closing any other open menu are
handled natively. Where the Popover API is unavailable it falls back to a
`position:fixed` panel positioned from the trigger's rect, so it **also
escapes the clipping** (only the native light-dismiss niceties differ).
Opening a row's menu selects that row, and choosing an item runs its action
against the selected row.

(For reference, `<grid-col type="…">` accepts `bool`, `btn`, `tags` and
`actions`; omit `type` for a plain text cell.)

## Tag columns

Columns with `type="tags"` render each value as a tag span. The row
field can be a CSV string, a JSON string, or an array from a JSON data
source:

```html
<grid-col name="problems" label="Problems" type="tags"></grid-col>
```

Supported values:

```json
"late,missing break"
["late", "missing break"]
[{"label":"late","color":"red"},{"label":"ok","class":"green"}]
```

Every tag receives `dg-tag` plus a color class. Text values are split
with `separator`, which defaults to comma. Tag cells wrap automatically,
so the row grows vertically when there are more tags than horizontal
space. Tags use a neutral gray style by default. Set `tag-color` on the
column to color every tag, or provide `color`, `class`, `variant`, or
`type` in object tag data to override a specific tag.

## Footer buttons

Add `<grid-footer-buttons>` as a direct child of the grid to place
buttons in the pagination footer. `side="left"` renders before the
pagination controls, `side="center"` renders between pagination and the
right-hand record counter, and `side="right"` renders after the counter
and built-in refresh button. If `side` is omitted, `right` is used.

Footer buttons are declared with `<closure-btn>` and execute against the
currently selected row:

```html
<closure-data-grid id="daysGrid" page-size="10">
  <grid-footer-buttons side="right">
    <closure-btn label="Issues"
                 icon="⚠"
                 mode="event"
                 event="open-issues"
                 bind="master_day_id"
                 data-action="open-issues"></closure-btn>
  </grid-footer-buttons>
</closure-data-grid>
```

## Example

```html
<closure-data-grid id="users">
  <grid-col name="username" label="User" width="20%"></grid-col>
  <grid-col name="role"     label="Role" width="15%" map-data-id="role-map"></grid-col>
  <grid-col name="active"   label="Status" width="10%" type="bool"></grid-col>
  <grid-key>username</grid-key>

  <query-definition url="/admin/users.json"></query-definition>
  <on-no-results><p>No users.</p></on-no-results>
</closure-data-grid>

<closure-row-viewer target="users">…</closure-row-viewer>
```

## Column sizing

`<grid-col width="...">` accepts:

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `width="120"` | `120px` (backwards-compatible numeric shorthand) |
| `width="12ch"` | any CSS length is passed through |
| `width="20%"` | percentage width |

If `width` is set and `align` is omitted, the grid keeps the legacy
behaviour of centering that column. Use `align="left"`,
`align="center"`, or `align="right"` to opt into a specific alignment.

For content-sized columns, add `auto-fit` to the grid. In this mode,
columns without `fill` are measured from their header/body text and the
column marked with `fill` receives the remaining horizontal space.

```html
<closure-data-grid id="periods" page-size="all" auto-fit>
  <grid-col name="from" label="From"></grid-col>
  <grid-col name="to"   label="To"></grid-col>
  <grid-col name="wd"   label="WD" align="right"></grid-col>
  <grid-col name="note" label="" fill></grid-col>

  <g-row>
    <g-col name="from">May 11, 2026</g-col>
    <g-col name="to">May 24, 2026</g-col>
    <g-col name="wd">14</g-col>
    <g-col name="note">Ready</g-col>
  </g-row>
</closure-data-grid>
```

Only `<grid-col>` supports `fill`; putting `fill` on `<g-col>` has no
effect because sizing is calculated per column, not per cell.

## CSS Variables

| Variable | Default |
|---|---|
| `--dg-border` | `var(--border, #e5e7eb)` |
| `--dg-bg`     | `#fff` |
| `--radius`    | `8px` |
| `--primary`   | `#4f46e5` |

## Behaviour

> **Note:** dynamic mode merges the live filter values from any paired
> `<closure-filter-bar>` into the request. Filter changes auto-call
> `refresh()` (resetting to page 1).

> **Note:** with `auto-page-size`, the grid measures its body and
> picks a `pageSize` that fills the viewport without overflow on first
> render. Manual `<grid-layout page-size="N">` always wins.

> **Note:** scroll disposition (`scroll="window|continuous"`):
> - **`window`** — the grid is a height-bounded box with internal scroll;
>   the mouse wheel over the body is captured to flip pages. This is the
>   mode for `page-size="auto"` and for any grid with a `max-rows` cap.
> - **`continuous`** — the grid flows at its natural height; the wheel is
>   **not** captured, so the native document scroll slides past the grid to
>   reach whatever follows it (page/dialog footer). Move through data with
>   the keyboard or the pagination buttons.
>
> When `scroll` is omitted it is inferred: `window` if `page-size="auto"`
> or a `max-rows` cap is set, otherwise `continuous`. A `max-rows` cap
> always forces `window` (the box is physically bounded, so it owns the
> scroll). Set `scroll` explicitly — on the host or via `<grid-layout>` —
> to override the inference.

> **Note:** `<filter-preset>` lets the markup expose one-click filter
> sets that the consumer can wire to buttons; the preset writes back
> through the filter bar so the chips visually update.

# `<closure-data-grid>` children

Markup-only elements consumed by `<closure-data-grid>`. Every one
renders `display: none` and exists purely to carry attributes the grid
reads on initialise. Defined together because they share the same
trivial implementation and are always loaded as a set.

## Tags

| Tag | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `<grid-col>`         | column descriptor: `name`, `label`, `width`, `align`, `fill`, `type`, `map-data-id` |
| `<grid-footer-buttons>` | extra pagination footer buttons; `side="left|center|right"` |
| `<grid-key>`         | per-row identity (text content is one or more `name`s, comma-separated) |
| `<grid-layout>`      | layout container: hoists `page-size`, `min-rows`, `max-rows`, `scroll="window\|continuous"` onto the grid (child value wins) |
| `<g-row>`            | one row of inline data (contains `<g-col>` cells) |
| `<g-col>`            | one cell inside `<g-row>`; `name="…"` matches a `<grid-col>` |
| `<g-detail>`         | nested detail rows inside a `<g-row>`; `name="…"` becomes an array field |
| `<query-definition>` | dynamic-mode endpoint: `url`, default headers / params |
| `<query-param>`      | maps an external value (filter, etc.) into a query parameter |
| `<on-no-results>`    | markup rendered when the grid has no rows |
| `<on-fetch-error>`   | markup rendered on dynamic-mode fetch failure |
| `<filter-preset>`    | predefined filter set the grid can apply via UI |
| `<filter-set-value-btn>` | quick value button consumed by `<closure-filter-bar>` |

## Example

```html
<closure-data-grid>
  <!-- columns -->
  <grid-col name="username" label="User"></grid-col>
  <grid-col name="role"     label="Role" map-data-id="role-map"></grid-col>

  <!-- inline rows -->
  <g-row><g-col name="username">jdoe</g-col><g-col name="role">admin</g-col></g-row>
  <g-row><g-col name="username">asmith</g-col><g-col name="role">viewer</g-col></g-row>

  <!-- empty / error states -->
  <on-no-results><p>No rows.</p></on-no-results>
  <on-fetch-error><p>Could not load.</p></on-fetch-error>
</closure-data-grid>
```

## `<grid-col>` sizing attributes

| Attribute | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `width="N"` | fixed width in pixels |
| `width="12ch"` / `width="20%"` | CSS length passed through |
| `align="left\|center\|right"` | explicit text alignment |
| `fill` | in an `auto-fit` grid, this column absorbs remaining width |

`fill` belongs on `<grid-col>`, not on `<g-col>`.

## Behaviour

> **Note:** the `customElements.define` calls are guarded — re-loading
> the bundle multiple times in the same document does not throw. Useful
> for hot-reloaded mockup pages.

> **Note:** none of these elements have any logic of their own. The
> grid reads their attributes synchronously on initialise; mutating
> them later does **not** trigger a re-read — call
> `<closure-data-grid>`'s `refresh()` to re-evaluate.

---

# `<closure-row-viewer>`

Projects the currently selected (or focused) row of a
`<closure-data-grid>` onto its descendants through `bind` attributes.
Subscribes to the grid's `row-select` and `row-focus` events; while no
row is selected it hides every bound child.

## Attributes

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| `target="id"` | id of the `<closure-data-grid>` to bind to |
| `keep-space` | hide all descendant `bind-show` / `bind-hide` toggles with `visibility` instead of `display` |

## Per-child binding attributes

| Attribute on a descendant | Effect |
|---|---|
| `bind="field"`        | write `row[field]` into the element (`textContent`, `.value` for value-bearing controls/components, `data-field` on `<closure-btn>` / `<closure-btn-item>`) |
| `bind="f1,f2"`        | on `<closure-btn>` only — set one `data-*` attribute per field |
| `bind-show="field"`   | show only when `row[field]` is truthy |
| `bind-show="field=v"` | show only when `row[field] === v` |
| `bind-hide="field"`   | hide when `row[field]` is truthy |
| `bind-hide="field=v"` | hide when `row[field] === v` |
| `bind-keep-space`     | on `bind-show` / `bind-hide`, hide with `visibility` instead of `display` |
| `bind-crlf="<br>"`    | when the bound text has line breaks, render via `innerHTML` with the given separator |
| `map-data-id="id"`    | resolve through a `<data-map>` for icon / label / color substitution |
| `map-show="icon"`     | with `map-data-id`, render only the icon part |
| `map-show="label"`    | with `map-data-id`, render only the label part |

## Properties

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
| `.row` (read-only) | the currently bound row object, or `null` |

## Example

```html
<closure-data-grid id="users-grid" …>…</closure-data-grid>

<closure-row-viewer target="users-grid">
  <span bind="username"></span>
  <span bind="role" map-data-id="role-map"></span>
  <span bind-show="active=1">✓ active</span>
  <span bind-show="active=0">✗ inactive</span>
  <span bind-hide="active">inactive only</span>
  <closure-btn ct-role="edit" bind="id">Edit</closure-btn>
</closure-row-viewer>
```

## Behaviour

> **Note:** elements with `[bind]` are hidden via `visibility: hidden`
> (so layout is preserved) when no row is selected. Elements with
> `[bind-show]` or `[bind-hide]` are hidden via `display: none`, unless
> the child has `bind-keep-space` or the viewer has `keep-space`.

> **Note:** `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<select>` and custom components
> exposing a `.value` property receive the value via that property. This
> lets components such as `<status-kv>` update their value span without
> replacing their internal structure. Other elements get `textContent`
> (or `innerHTML` when `bind-crlf` is set).

> **Note:** when a `<data-map>` resolution returns a `color` field, that
> colour is applied to the bound element's `style.color`. Cleared on the
> next bind without a colour.

---

# `<closure-checkbox-tree>`

Cascading checkbox tree with Shadow DOM. The structure is declared in
light DOM via `<cbt-item>` children; the actual checkboxes are
rendered inside the shadow root. `formAssociated`, so the tree
participates in form submission as a single field.

Reach for it when a form needs a **hierarchical multi-select that posts as one
field** — permissions, category pickers, org units — where parent rows reflect
and drive their children (check a parent → all descendants; a partial set →
indeterminate parent). Being `formAssociated`, it behaves like a native control:
it has a `name`, a value, and submits with the form; the collapsed pill keeps a
large tree compact until the user opens it.

It is **not** a generic tree-view or file explorer: every node is a checkbox,
there is no drag-drop, lazy-loading or per-node action — the whole tree is
declared up front in light DOM via `<cbt-item>`, and its only output is the
aggregated selection.

Two visual modes:

| Mode | Trigger | Shows |
|---|---|---|
| **Collapsed** | default | root label + three buttons `All(1)` / `None(0)` / `Custom(2)`; `Custom` opens a `<closure-lightbox>` with the full tree |
| **Expanded**  | `expanded` attr | full checkbox tree inline |

## Attributes

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| `name="x"`              | tree name (used in paths and as the form field name) |
| `branch-name="omit"`    | leave the tree name out of the paths (`/<item>/…` instead of `/<name>/<item>/…`); default `include`. Also inherited from the enclosing `<closure-checkbox-group>` |
| `expanded`              | render the full tree inline instead of the collapsed pill |
| `readonly`              | disable every checkbox in shadow DOM |
| `send-only-active`      | emit only the nodes that are on: checked leaves and parents whose tree value is not `0`. Also inherited from the enclosing `<closure-checkbox-group>` |
| `label-all="All"`       | label for the All state |
| `label-none="None"`     | label for the None state |
| `label-custom="Custom"` | label for the Custom state |

## Children

`<cbt-item>` elements (see [`<cbt-item>`](#cbt-item)). May nest to any
depth; intermediate items become parent rows that aggregate the state
of their descendants.

## Form value

The form value is a minified JSON string with the shape:

```json
[ [path, v, vt], … ]
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `path` | leading-slash path through the tree, e.g. `/section/sub-1`; it starts with the tree `name` unless `branch-name="omit"` |
| `v`    | leaf value — `0` (off) or non-zero (on); `null` for parents |
| `vt`   | tree value — `0` (none), `1` (all), `2` (custom); `null` for leaves |

## Properties

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
| `.value` (get) | the JSON string above |

## Methods

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `getValues()`     | array of `[path, v, vt]` for all nodes (only the active ones with `send-only-active`) |
| `setValues(arr)`  | restore from `[[path, v, vt], …]` |
| `checkAll()`      | check every leaf |
| `uncheckAll()`    | uncheck every leaf |
| `getSummaryHTML()`| markdown-ish summary used by `<closure-summary>` |

## Events

| Event | Bubbles | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| `change` | yes | (none) |

Fired on any leaf or parent state change.

## Example

```html
<closure-checkbox-tree name="privileges">
  <cbt-item name="users" label="Users">
    <cbt-item name="view"   label="View"></cbt-item>
    <cbt-item name="edit"   label="Edit"></cbt-item>
    <cbt-item name="delete" label="Delete" tip="Permanent"></cbt-item>
  </cbt-item>
  <cbt-item name="reports" label="Reports">
    <cbt-item name="view"   label="View"></cbt-item>
    <cbt-item name="export" label="Export"></cbt-item>
  </cbt-item>
</closure-checkbox-tree>
```

## Behaviour

> **Note:** the **Custom** button opens a `<closure-lightbox>`
> containing the expanded tree. Picks made there commit on close.
> The collapsed/expanded distinction is purely visual — the form value
> format is identical in both modes.

> **Note:** parent rows have **tri-state** semantics: an indeterminate
> visual state when descendants are mixed, fully checked when every
> descendant is on, fully unchecked when every descendant is off.

> **Note:** `setValues` ignores entries whose `path` doesn't exist in
> the current tree. Useful when restoring data from a wider permission
> set than is currently displayed.

> **Note:** with `send-only-active` the value lists only what is on: a
> leaf appears when it is checked (`[path, 1, null]`) and a parent when
> its tree value is `1` (all) or `2` (custom). Unchecked leaves and
> fully-off parents are left out, so an absent path means "off" and a
> tree with nothing checked submits `[]`. It only shapes the output:
> `src` and `setValues` take the same data either way. The attribute is
> looked up each time the value is computed; toggling it at runtime
> reaches the submitted form value on the next change.

> **Note:** with `branch-name="omit"` the paths carry only the
> `<cbt-item>` names: a tree whose single root item is `users` emits
> `/users`, `/users/view`, … whatever the tree itself is called. Use it
> when the server already owns a path scheme and the tree name is just
> a label for the widget. The attribute is read once, when the tree is
> built. See [`<closure-checkbox-group>`](#closure-checkbox-group) for a
> side-by-side table of both forms.

---

# `<cbt-item>`

Structure-only element used inside `<closure-checkbox-tree>`. Carries
the metadata for one node of the tree (name, label, tip) and may
nest other `<cbt-item>` children to form sub-branches. The element
itself never renders — it's the parent tree that paints checkboxes
into its Shadow DOM based on this markup.

## Attributes

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| `name="x"`  | node identifier; combined with parent names to build the path |
| `label="x"` | display text in the tree |
| `tip="x"`   | optional tooltip / description (shown via `title`) |

## Example

```html
<closure-checkbox-tree name="reports">
  <cbt-item name="weekly"  label="Weekly"  tip="Tuesday morning"></cbt-item>
  <cbt-item name="monthly" label="Monthly">
    <cbt-item name="payroll"   label="Payroll"></cbt-item>
    <cbt-item name="inventory" label="Inventory"></cbt-item>
  </cbt-item>
</closure-checkbox-tree>
```

## Behaviour

> **Note:** the path of a node is the leading-slash join of its
> ancestors' `name`s (including the tree's `name`). Two siblings can
> share a `name` value across different branches without colliding —
> the tree disambiguates by full path.

---

# `<closure-checkbox-group>`

Bundles several `<closure-checkbox-tree>` instances into one
form-associated field. Submits a single value containing every tree's
selections, either as a concatenated flat list or as an object keyed
by tree name.

Use it when a form needs **several related checkbox trees submitted together as
one field** — e.g. permissions split into sections by resource type — without
wiring each tree's value by hand. The trees stay independent: the group only
concatenates their values into one payload; it does not cascade or share
selection state between them.

## Attributes

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| `name="x"`           | form field name |
| `output="flat"`      | flat array (default) — every tree's leaves concatenated |
| `output="sections"`  | object `{ treeName: [[path, v, vt], …] }` |
| `branch-name="omit"` | child trees leave their own name out of the paths (`/<item>/…`); default `include` (`/<treeName>/<item>/…`) |
| `readonly`           | propagates `readonly` to every child tree |
| `send-only-active`   | child trees emit only the nodes that are on (checked leaves, parents not fully off) instead of every node |
| `src="id"`           | id of an element whose `textContent` is parsed as JSON to seed initial values |
| `summary="id"`       | id of a paired `<closure-summary>` to refresh on changes |

## Children

`<closure-checkbox-tree>` elements (see [`<closure-checkbox-tree>`](#closure-checkbox-tree)).

## Form value

Same JSON serialisation as `<closure-checkbox-tree>` but combined:

- **flat**: `[ [path, v, vt], … ]` from every tree, in DOM order
- **sections**: `{ "tree-1": [...], "tree-2": [...] }`

In `flat` mode each path begins with `/<treeName>/…` so the server
can still demultiplex. With `branch-name="omit"` that leading segment is
dropped and the paths start at the first `<cbt-item>`; `sections` output
stays keyed by tree name either way.

### Paths and `branch-name`

Every tree puts its own `name` in front of its paths. That keeps the trees
of a flat payload apart, but when a tree wraps a single root item of the
same name — the usual shape for one section of a permission set — the
segment shows up twice. `branch-name="omit"` on the group leaves it out:

```html
<closure-checkbox-group name="privileges" branch-name="omit">
  <closure-checkbox-tree name="contacts" label="Users and Roles">
    <cbt-item name="contacts" label="Users and Roles">
      <cbt-item name="employee" label="Employees"></cbt-item>
      <cbt-item name="admin"    label="Admins"></cbt-item>
    </cbt-item>
  </closure-checkbox-tree>
  <closure-checkbox-tree name="audit" label="Audit">
    <cbt-item name="audit" label="Audit"></cbt-item>
  </closure-checkbox-tree>
</closure-checkbox-group>
```

| Node | `branch-name="include"` (default) | `branch-name="omit"` |
|---|---|---|
| section `contacts` | `/contacts/contacts`          | `/contacts` |
| leaf `employee`    | `/contacts/contacts/employee` | `/contacts/employee` |
| leaf `admin`       | `/contacts/contacts/admin`    | `/contacts/admin` |
| section `audit`    | `/audit/audit`                | `/audit` |

Seed data (`src`, `setValues(...)`, `.value = …`) uses the same paths the
group emits, so with `omit` it carries no tree-name segment either.

## Properties

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
| `.value` (get) | the JSON string above |

## Methods

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `getValues()`        | structured data (array or object depending on `output`) |
| `setValues(data)`    | restore from a matching shape |
| `checkAll()`         | check every leaf in every tree |
| `uncheckAll()`       | clear every leaf in every tree |
| `getSummaryHTML()`   | concatenated summary of every tree (consumed by `<closure-summary>`) |

## Events

| Event | Bubbles | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| `change` | yes (from the trees) | (none) |

## Example

```html
<closure-checkbox-group name="privileges" output="sections" summary="priv-summary">
  <closure-checkbox-tree name="users">
    <cbt-item name="view"   label="View users"></cbt-item>
    <cbt-item name="edit"   label="Edit users"></cbt-item>
  </closure-checkbox-tree>
  <closure-checkbox-tree name="reports">
    <cbt-item name="view"   label="View reports"></cbt-item>
    <cbt-item name="export" label="Export reports"></cbt-item>
  </closure-checkbox-tree>
</closure-checkbox-group>

<closure-summary id="priv-summary" source="privileges"></closure-summary>
```

## Behaviour

> **Note:** the group is `formAssociated` itself (via ElementInternals)
> — when the form serialises, the group submits one field; its child
> trees do not submit individually.

> **Note:** in `flat` mode, `setValues(data)` filters entries by their
> leading `/<treeName>/` so each tree gets only its own subset. Cross-tree
> noise is silently ignored. With `branch-name="omit"` there is no such
> prefix: every tree is handed the whole list and keeps the paths it has.

> **Note:** `branch-name` is read once, when each tree is built. A tree
> may also set it for itself, overriding the group.

> **Note:** `send-only-active` shrinks the payload to what is on, so an
> absent path means "off"; with nothing checked the group submits `[]`
> (`flat`) or an object of empty arrays (`sections`). It does not change
> what `src` / `setValues` accept. See
> [`<closure-checkbox-tree>`](#closure-checkbox-tree) for the exact rule.

> **Note:** `src` is read once on connect. To re-seed later, call
> `setValues(...)` with the new payload.

# `<closure-tab-bar>`

Tab control that manages a set of `<closure-tab>` panels. Renders a
button bar above the panels; the active tab's panel is shown, the rest
are hidden. No Shadow DOM — buttons are added in light DOM.

Use it to switch between sibling content panels **without navigation or
fetching** — the panels already exist on the page and the bar just toggles which
one is visible. It is not a router or a lazy-loader: every `<closure-tab>` and
its content are present up front; the bar manages selection, visibility and (per
tab) an optional enable/disable toggle, nothing more.

## Attributes

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| `active="name"` | initially active tab (default: first tab) |

## Children

`<closure-tab>` elements (see [`<closure-tab>`](#closure-tab) for
attributes).

## Methods

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `select(name)` | activate the tab with that `name`; no-op if no match |
| `getActive()`  | returns the `name` of the currently active tab (or `""`) |

## Events

| Event | Bubbles | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| `tab-change` | yes | `{ name, prev }` |

Fired when the active tab changes (programmatically or via click). Not
fired when the user re-clicks the already-active tab.

## Example

```html
<closure-tab-bar active="signin">
  <closure-tab name="contact" label="Contact" icon="✉">
    <p>Get in touch…</p>
  </closure-tab>
  <closure-tab name="signin" label="Sign in" toggle="enable" toggle-target="signin-on">
    <input type="hidden" id="signin-on" name="signin_enabled" value="1">
    <p>Sign-in form…</p>
  </closure-tab>
</closure-tab-bar>
```

## CSS Variables

| Variable | Default | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `--border`         | `#e5e7eb`    | bar bottom + button border |
| `--font`           | `sans-serif` | button font |
| `--text`           | `#111827` | active button text |
| `--text-muted`     | `#6b7280` | inactive button text |
| `--tab-bg`         | `#f5f5f5` | inactive button background |
| `--tab-bg-hover`   | `#e8e8e8` | hover background |
| `--tab-bg-active`  | `#fff`    | active button background |

## Behaviour

> **Note:** the bar lazily initialises on `DOMContentLoaded` (or
> `requestAnimationFrame` if the document is already parsed). Adding
> `<closure-tab>` children **after** that runs requires calling
> `_syncButtons()` manually — there's no MutationObserver.

> **Note:** when a tab uses `toggle="enable\|disable"`, clicking the
> in-button checkbox also writes `0`/`1` into `toggle-target` (when set),
> so the dirty form value reflects the panel's enabled state.

> **Note:** when `show-source` flips the active tab to `hidden`, the bar
> automatically advances selection to the first still-visible tab.

> **Note:** the active panel ships with a default frame — padding,
> a border matching the bar (`--border`) and a `--tab-bg-active`
> background — so the tabs look connected out of the box with no
> page CSS. Override `closure-tab[active]` to restyle it.

---

# `<closure-tab>`

A single tab panel inside `<closure-tab-bar>`. Holds the panel content
and the metadata (label, icon, disabled, hidden, toggle behaviour) the
parent bar uses to paint its trigger button.

## Attributes

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| `name="x"`            | tab identifier (used by `select(name)`) |
| `label="x"`           | button text |
| `icon="x"`            | button icon (prepended to label) |
| `disabled`            | tab cannot be selected |
| `hidden`              | tab button hidden (panel hidden too) |
| `toggle="enable"`     | adds a checkbox to the button; panel starts disabled, check to enable |
| `toggle="disable"`    | adds a checkbox to the button; panel starts enabled, check to disable |
| `toggle-target="id"`  | hidden input to keep in sync with the toggle (writes `0`/`1`) |
| `show-source="id"`    | external checkbox whose state shows / hides this tab |

The parent bar listens to attribute changes (`hidden`, `disabled`,
`label`, `icon`) and re-renders its button row.

## Example

```html
<closure-tab-bar>
  <closure-tab name="overview" label="Overview" icon="🏠">…</closure-tab>
  <closure-tab name="advanced" label="Advanced"
               toggle="enable" toggle-target="advanced-on">
    <input type="hidden" id="advanced-on" name="advanced_enabled" value="0">
    …
  </closure-tab>
</closure-tab-bar>
```

## Behaviour

> **Note:** disabling a `closure-tab` does **not** dispatch
> `tab-change` if it was active — the bar will refuse to select the
> disabled tab on subsequent clicks but the panel stays in its current
> visibility state until the user picks another tab.

> **Note:** `toggled-off` (the attribute set when the toggle is off)
> hides every direct child except `<input type="hidden">` so the panel
> still submits its hidden value while showing nothing.

---

# `<closure-summary>`

Read-only renderer fed by a "source" element through a tiny one-way
contract. The summary asks the source for its initial HTML at connect
time; the source pushes updates by calling `refresh(html)` on the
summary when its state changes.

## Pairing

The two elements reference each other by id:

```html
<!-- source must implement getSummaryHTML() -->
<closure-checkbox-group id="privs" summary="priv-summary">…</closure-checkbox-group>

<closure-summary id="priv-summary" source="privs"></closure-summary>
```

The source must:
- expose `getSummaryHTML()` returning an HTML string,
- on every internal change, look up the element pointed at by its
  `summary` attribute and call its `refresh(...)` with the new HTML.

## Attributes

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| `source="id"` | id of the source element |

## Methods

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `refresh(html)` | replace the rendered summary |

## CSS Variables

Consumed (for the shadow-DOM list styling):

| Variable | Default |
|---|---|
| `--summary-font-size`     | `12px` |
| `--summary-color`         | `inherit` |
| `--summary-indent`        | `1.2em` |
| `--summary-list-style`    | `disc` |
| `--summary-li-margin`     | `2px 0` |
| `--summary-strong-weight` | `bold` |

## Behaviour

> **Note:** the summary uses Shadow DOM and re-applies its base style
> on every `refresh(...)` — keep `getSummaryHTML()` cheap; expensive
> work belongs upstream in the source.

> **Note:** if the source isn't yet in the DOM at connect time, the
> initial render is skipped silently. The next `refresh(...)` call
> from the source will catch up.

---

# `<closure-form-row>`

Responsive form row that lays out `<closure-form-field>` children in a
CSS grid (when `cols` is given) or flex (when not). Optionally
collapses to a single column when its width drops below `min`.
Light-DOM only — styles are injected once into `<head>`.

## Attributes

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| `cols="*,4em,6em"` | grid template — `*` becomes `1fr`, integers become `Nfr`, anything else passes verbatim |
| `labels="top"`     | labels above fields (default) |
| `labels="side"` / `labels="left"` | labels to the left, inline with the field |
| `labels="right"`   | labels to the right |
| `labels="checkbox-left"` / `labels="checkbox-right"` | label-as-side variants for checkbox layouts |
| `gap="10px"`       | gap between fields (default `10px`) |
| `min="600px"`      | when narrower than this, collapse to one column (sets `cfr-collapsed`) |
| `wrap`             | flex layout: allow rows to wrap |

## Children

`<closure-form-field>` elements (see [`<closure-form-field>`](#closure-form-field)).

## Density

The row inherits `--cfr-*` variables from any ancestor with a
`density="sm\|lg\|xl"` attribute, so a single attribute on a wrapper
re-skins every form below. Available presets:

| Density | Effect |
|---|---|
| `sm` | smaller font / tighter padding / shorter rows |
| `lg` | larger font / roomier padding / taller rows |
| `xl` | extra large |

## Example

```html
<div density="lg">
  <closure-form-row cols="*,4em,6em" gap="14px" min="500px">
    <closure-form-field label="First name" required>
      <input type="text" name="fname">
    </closure-form-field>
    <closure-form-field label="MI">
      <input type="text" name="mi" maxlength="1">
    </closure-form-field>
    <closure-form-field label="DOB">
      <input type="date" name="dob">
    </closure-form-field>
  </closure-form-row>
</div>
```

## CSS Variables

The row both **declares defaults** for its density tokens and
**consumes** the same tokens when laying things out:

| Variable | Default (md) | sm | lg | xl |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--cfr-font`        | `13px`       | `11px` | `15px` | `18px` |
| `--cfr-label-font`  | `11px`       | `9px`  | `12px` | `14px` |
| `--cfr-padding`     | `4px 6px`    | `2px 4px` | `6px 10px` | `10px 14px` |
| `--cfr-gap`         | `6px`        | `6px`  | `14px` | `18px` |
| `--cfr-row-mb`      | `6px`        | `4px`  | `10px` | `14px` |
| `--cfr-msg-font`    | `10px`       | `8px`  | `12px` | `13px` |
| `--cfr-pwd-h`       | `23px`       | `18px` | `30px` | `40px` |
| `--cfr-pwd-lh`      | `15px`       | `12px` | `20px` | `24px` |
| `--cfr-label-width` | `80px`       |        |        |        |
| `--cfr-ro-bg`       | `#f8f8f8`    |        |        |        |
| `--cfr-ro-color`    | `#666`       |        |        |        |
| `--cfr-ro-border`   | `#e5e5e5`    |        |        |        |
| `--cfr-ro-label`    | `#999`       |        |        |        |
| `--text-muted`      | `#6b7280`       |        |        |        |
| `--red`             | `#dc2626`       |        |        |        |
| `--warning`         | `#d97706`    |        |        |        |

## Behaviour

> **Note:** when `cols` is set the row uses CSS Grid and ignores per-field
> `width`/`flex` (only `min` and `max` apply). Without `cols` the row
> uses flex and each field's `width`/`flex`/`min`/`max` decide its size.

> **Note:** `min` installs a `ResizeObserver` and toggles the
> `cfr-collapsed` attribute on the host. Children with
> `hide-on-collapse` disappear in that mode — useful for secondary
> fields on narrow screens.

> **Note:** field-level error / warning messages are written into a
> single `.cfr-msg` span the row creates lazily after build. Setting
> both `error` and `warning` on the same field shows the error message.

---

# `<closure-form-field>`

A single labelled field inside a `<closure-form-row>`. Wraps its
content in a `.cfr-body` so the row can stack a label above
(or beside) it. Surfaces validation hints (`error`, `warning`,
`required`) and a hidden inline message that the parent row updates.

Use it to wrap a single input (or `<credential-pwd>`, checkbox tree, etc.) that
needs a label and inline validation messaging inside a form. It does not lay
itself out — width, label position and responsive collapse are decided by the
parent `<closure-form-row>`; the field just owns its label, body wrapper and
error / warning hint.

## Attributes

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| `label="x"`         | label text (rendered in a `.cfr-label` span) |
| `labels="top\|side\|left\|right\|checkbox-left\|checkbox-right"` | per-field override of the row's label position |
| `flex="N"`          | flex grow factor (only when the row is **not** using `cols`) |
| `width="Npx"`       | fixed width (only when the row is **not** using `cols`) |
| `min="Npx"`         | minimum width |
| `max="Npx"`         | maximum width |
| `required`          | adds the trailing `*` indicator on the label |
| `error="x"`         | red border + the message in `.cfr-msg`; takes priority over `warning` |
| `warning="x"`       | amber border + the message in `.cfr-msg` |
| `hide-on-collapse`  | hide this field when the parent row is in collapsed mode |

The label, body wrapper and message span are created by the parent
`<closure-form-row>` on first build — see that component for the full
structural contract.

## Children

Whatever input markup belongs in the body — typically `<input>`,
`<select>`, `<textarea>`, `<credential-pwd>`, `<closure-checkbox-tree>`,
`<closure-checkbox-group>`, `<fingerprint-hands>`. Every direct
descendant gets moved into the `.cfr-body` wrapper at build time.

## Example

```html
<closure-form-row cols="*,2*">
  <closure-form-field label="Email" required>
    <input type="email" name="email">
  </closure-form-field>
  <closure-form-field label="Password" labels="top" warning="Must be at least 12 characters">
    <credential-pwd name="password" required></credential-pwd>
  </closure-form-field>
</closure-form-row>
```

## Behaviour

> **Note:** changing `error` / `warning` after build re-renders the
> message span only; `required` flips the label suffix on the fly. The
> field's children are **not** rebuilt — once moved into `.cfr-body`,
> they stay there.

> **Note:** `error` always wins over `warning` when both are present.
> Clearing both hides the message span (`display: none`).

> **Note:** `flex`, `width`, `min`, `max` are interpreted by the parent
> `<closure-form-row>`. With `cols` set on the row, only `min` / `max`
> have any effect.

---

# `<closure-data-source>`

Reactive data container that turns inline rows into a set of dependent
`<select>` populations. Renders nothing itself (`display: none`); the
real UI is the `<select>` elements it points at.

The data is declared inline using `<g-row><g-col name="…">value</g-col>`
children (same pattern as `<closure-data-grid>`). Each
`<observed-select>` child describes one population:
which select to fill, which row fields supply the option key and label,
and (optionally) which other select acts as a cascading filter.

Use it for **small, static cascading dropdowns** — country → state → city,
category → subcategory — where the options are known up front and a network
round-trip per change would be overkill. Because the rows are baked into the
HTML, it is not meant for large or live datasets: for those, fetch from the
server and populate the selects yourself.

## Attributes

None. Configuration lives in the children.

## Children

### `<g-row><g-col name="x">…</g-col></g-row>`

Each `<g-row>` is one row. Each `<g-col name="x">` cell becomes a
field; cell text is trimmed.

### `<observed-select>`

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| `list-id="id"`           | id of the `<select>` to populate |
| `key-field="name"`       | row field used as option `value` |
| `label-field="name"`     | row field used as option text (defaults to key) |
| `filter-control="id"`    | id of another `<select>` whose value filters this one |
| `filter-field="name"`    | row field to compare with the filter control's value |
| `selected-value="x"`     | initial selection after the first population |
| `blank-value-key="x"`    | when present, prepend a blank option with this `value` |
| `blank-value-label="x"`  | label for the blank option (defaults to empty) |

## Example

```html
<closure-data-source>
  <g-row><g-col name="country">US</g-col><g-col name="country_name">United States</g-col><g-col name="state">NY</g-col><g-col name="state_name">New York</g-col></g-row>
  <g-row><g-col name="country">US</g-col><g-col name="country_name">United States</g-col><g-col name="state">CA</g-col><g-col name="state_name">California</g-col></g-row>
  <g-row><g-col name="country">CA</g-col><g-col name="country_name">Canada</g-col><g-col name="state">ON</g-col><g-col name="state_name">Ontario</g-col></g-row>

  <observed-select list-id="sel-country"
                   key-field="country" label-field="country_name"></observed-select>
  <observed-select list-id="sel-state"
                   key-field="state" label-field="state_name"
                   filter-control="sel-country" filter-field="country"></observed-select>
</closure-data-source>

<select id="sel-country"></select>
<select id="sel-state"></select>
```

## Behaviour

> **Note:** populated options are **deduplicated by key** — duplicate
> rows for the same country won't repeat the country option.

> **Note:** initial population uses `selected-value` if set; on every
> cascade after that, the dependent select resets to its blank entry
> (when one was declared) instead of preserving a now-illegal choice.

> **Note:** every population fires a non-bubbling `change` event on the
> populated select so further dependents update in turn.

# `<fingerprint-hands>`

Two-hand SVG diagram for capturing or displaying which fingerprints have
been recorded. Shadow DOM, `formAssociated`. Each finger is independently
selectable / toggleable.

Finger naming: `l1`–`l5` for the left hand (`l1`=thumb), `r1`–`r5` for
the right hand (`r1`=thumb).

Use it as a form-associated **state diagram** for a biometric-capture workflow:
it shows, per finger, whether a print has been recorded and — with `toggle` —
lets an operator mark fingers by hand, e.g. an enrolment screen that pairs it
with an external scanner driving the state. As a `formAssociated` control it
carries a `name` and posts its per-finger string with the form, like any input.

It does **not** read or capture actual fingerprints — there is no scanner
integration here; it only renders and edits the *recorded / not-recorded* state
you feed it (via attributes, `value`, or clicks).

## Attributes

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| `size="sm\|md\|lg\|xl\|xxl"` | overall size (default `md`) — 80 / 120 / 160 / 220 / 300 px |
| `name="x"`                   | form field name (read by ElementInternals) |
| `toggle`                     | clicks / Space / Enter flip the finger between on/off |
| `readonly`                   | every finger renders but isn't interactive |
| `l1` … `l5`, `r1` … `r5`     | per-finger state — `1`/`on` = captured (green), `0`/`off` = empty (grey), `-1`/`disabled` = palm-coloured & ignored by the form |
| `value="l1:1,l2:0,…"`        | bulk-set state via the form value format |

When an attribute is absent, the finger defaults to `off`.

## Form value

```
l1:1,l2:0,l3:0,l4:0,l5:0,r1:1,r2:0,r3:0,r4:0,r5:0
```

Disabled fingers are encoded as `-1` so the server can distinguish
"not captured" from "not applicable".

## Properties

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
| `.value` (get) | the form-value string above |
| `.value` (set) | parses the form-value format and applies it as attributes |

## Events

| Event | Bubbles | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| `finger-click` | yes | `{ finger, state }` (state after the click) |

Fired on click, on Space, and on Enter when the focus indicator is on a
non-disabled finger.

## Example

```html
<fingerprint-hands size="lg" name="fingers"
                   l1="1" l3="on" l4="disabled"
                   toggle></fingerprint-hands>
```

## CSS Variables

| Variable | Default | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `--fh-captured`        | `#4ade80` | captured fill |
| `--fh-captured-stroke` | `#22c55e` | captured stroke |
| `--fh-empty`           | `#e5e5e5` | empty fill |
| `--fh-empty-stroke`    | `#bbb`    | empty stroke |
| `--fh-palm`            | `#f5f5f5` | palm + disabled fill |
| `--fh-palm-stroke`     | `#ddd`    | palm + disabled stroke |
| `--fh-focus`           | `#3b82f6` | finger focus stroke |
| `--fh-focus-ring`      | `#3b82f6` | host focus ring |
| `--text-muted`         | `#6b7280`    | "Left" / "Right" labels |

## Behaviour

> **Note:** keyboard navigation walks the fingers in anatomical order
> (left pinky → left thumb → right thumb → right pinky), wrapping at
> both ends and skipping disabled fingers.

> **Note:** the host gets `tabindex="0"` automatically. The visual focus
> ring uses `:focus-visible` so it appears for keyboard users only.

> **Note:** without `toggle` the click still fires `finger-click` but
> doesn't change state — useful for read-only displays where the host
> wants to react to clicks externally.

---

# `<session-keep-alive>`

Idle countdown for admin / bookkeeper portal sessions. Renders a small
`<closure-btn>` showing the remaining time before automatic logout.
Clicking the button extends the session (optionally consulting the
server). When the countdown reaches zero the page navigates to the
configured logoff URL.

## Attributes

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| `timeout="seconds"`   | initial countdown in seconds (default `1800` — 30 min) |
| `warn-at="seconds"`   | switch the button to red warning when remaining ≤ this (default `60`) |
| `extend-url="path"`   | POST here on click to extend the **server** session; without it, the click only resets the client countdown |
| `expire-url="path"`   | POST here when the countdown reaches zero (browser navigates to whatever the server responds); without it, only the `session-expired` event fires |
| `activity-reset`      | also reset the countdown on any mouse / keyboard / touch activity |
| `data-*`              | sent as form fields with both `extend-url` and `expire-url` POSTs (e.g. `data-sid="…"`) |

### `extend-url` JSON contract

| Response | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `{"ok":true,  "until":"<ISO>"}`                                              | granted, set countdown from now until `until` |
| `{"ok":true,  "remaining":<seconds>}`                                        | granted, set countdown to `remaining` seconds |
| `{"ok":true}` (no `until` / `remaining`)                                     | granted, reset to `timeout` |
| `{"ok":false, "redirect":"<url>", "method":"POST"\|"GET", "payload":{…}}`    | denied — client navigates as instructed |

Anything else → `session-extend-failed` event, **no** countdown reset.

> **Clock skew — prefer `remaining`.** `until` is resolved against the
> **browser clock** (`new Date(until) − Date.now()`), so a user whose
> system clock is off will see the session end early or late. Return
> **`remaining`** (exact seconds, computed server-side) when the client
> clock can't be trusted — it is immune to skew. `until` stays available
> for convenience when the client clock is reliable. (This element does
> **not** reuse `<clock-display>`'s server-time offset: that offset is
> private per `<clock-display>` instance and may not be present on the
> page, so `remaining` is the robust path.)

## Events

| Event | Bubbles | Detail | Fired when |
|---|---|---|---|
| `session-expired`       | yes | (none)                    | countdown reaches zero (right before the `expire-url` POST, if any) |
| `session-extended`      | yes | server response (or none) | extend was granted (server `ok` or `extend-url` unset) |
| `session-extend-failed` | yes | server response (or `{}`) | extend fetch failed (network or server `!ok` without redirect) |

## Example

```html
<session-keep-alive
  timeout="900"
  warn-at="120"
  extend-url="/admin/keep-alive"
  expire-url="/admin/logoff"
  data-sid="abc123"
  activity-reset></session-keep-alive>
```

## CSS Variables

| Variable | Default | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `--ska-warn-bg`     | `#fee2e2` | warn-state background |
| `--ska-warn-color`  | `var(--red, #dc2626)` | warn-state text colour |

## Behaviour

> **Note:** every `data-*` attribute on the host is mirrored as a form
> field on **both** the extend POST and the expire POST. Use it to
> propagate identifiers (session id, csrf token, etc.) without extra
> wiring.

> **Note:** the warning state toggles automatically via the `warn` host
> attribute when the countdown crosses `warn-at`. Style it (or override
> the CSS variables above) to integrate with your colour scheme.

> **Note:** with `activity-reset`, the listeners are attached to the
> document with `passive: true` and removed on disconnect. They reset
> the countdown but do **not** call the server — only the explicit
> button click hits `extend-url`.

## Install

Two ways to get the bundle:

- **GitHub release** — download `closure-ui.min.js` (or the readable
  `closure-ui.js`) from the
  [latest release](https://github.com/pablo-botella/closure-ui/releases/latest);
  every release also carries version-stamped twins and `checksums.txt`.
- **npm** — `npm i closure-ui` (also pnpm/yarn/bun).

## Usage

Include the bundled script in your page:

```html
<script src="release/closure-ui.min.js"></script>
```

Or straight from a CDN — pin the exact version you tested:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/closure-ui@0/closure-ui.min.js"></script>
```

Then use any of the elements:

```html
<btn-grid cols="2">
  <closure-btn ct-role="save">Save</closure-btn>
  <closure-btn ct-role="cancel">Cancel</closure-btn>
</btn-grid>

<clock-display small dot></clock-display>
```

Full per-component documentation (attributes, events, CSS variables,
examples) is generated into [`release/closure-ui.md`](release/closure-ui.md).
